## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### What I Learned This Session

1. **LLMs as Reasoning Engines:** Not just routers, actual thinking systems
2. **ReAct Pattern Power:** Proven framework enables ANY problem handling
3. **Tool Use Critical:** Real diagnostics vs assumptions changes everything
4. **General > Specific:** Design for ANY problem type, not fixed scenarios
5. **Research Matters:** 2024/2025 patterns are mature and proven

### What Craig Taught Me

1. **Think Bigger:** Not simple routing, complex reasoning
2. **Multi-Dimensional:** Seven layers working together
3. **Verify Everything:** Tools check claims, don't assume
4. **LLM-Guided Core:** The fundamental architecture principle
5. **Latest Research:** Always use current best practices
