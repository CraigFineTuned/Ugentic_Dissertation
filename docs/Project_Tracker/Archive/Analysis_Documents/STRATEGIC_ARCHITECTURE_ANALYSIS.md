issue = "Intermittent application timeout affecting multiple users"

# Use sequential thinking for planning
thought_1 = "Need to identify: affected users, time patterns, common factors"
thought_2 = "Hypothesis A: Network congestion"
thought_3 = "Hypothesis B: Application server overload"
# Branch to explore both
branch_a = investigate_network()
branch_b = investigate_app_server()
# Revise based on findings
thought_4 = "Network normal, server CPU at 95% - focusing on Hypothesis B"
```

**Benefits:**
- Better handling of ambiguous multi-domain problems
- Explicit reasoning traces for research analysis
- Ability to explore multiple hypotheses
- Clear documentation of decision reasoning

**UGENTIC Application:**

**Current Approach:**
Each agent has hard-coded tools (defined in agent initialization)

**Elysia Enhancement:**
```python
# Context-aware tool selection
context = {
    "issue_type": "database_timeout",
    "severity": "high",
    "affected_users": 15,
    "time_of_day": "peak_hours"
}

# Decision tree determines optimal tool sequence
tools = decision_tree.select_tools(context)
# Returns: [check_connection_pool, analyze_slow_queries, check_server_load]
# Instead of: all_available_tools
```

**Benefits:**
- Faster issue resolution (fewer irrelevant tool calls)
- Reduced LLM reasoning load
- Pattern-based tool optimization
- Measurable efficiency improvements

**Implementation:**
1. Analyze Elysia's decision tree implementation
2. Create `src/ugentic/core/tool_decision_tree.py`
3. Train tree on historical investigation logs

1. Create `plans/` directory in UGENTIC root
2. Add `src/ugentic/core/explicit_planning.py`:
```python
class ExplicitPlanner:
    def create_plan(self, objective, agent_name):
        """Create structured investigation plan"""
        plan = {
            "objective": objective,
            "created_by": agent_name,
            "steps": [],
            "status": "active",
            "blockers": []
        }
        return plan
    
    def update_step(self, plan_id, step_number, status, notes):
        """Update plan step status"""
        # Read plan markdown
        # Update step status (pending/in_progress/completed/failed)
        # Add notes about findings
        # Write back to markdown
        pass
    
    def check_plan(self, plan_id):
        """Check current plan status"""
        # Return current objectives, completed steps, next actions
        pass
```

3. Integrate with ReAct engine:
```python
# Before ReAct loop
plan = planner.create_plan(problem_report, self.agent_name)

# During ReAct loop
if iteration == 0:
    plan.add_step("Gather initial information", "in_progress")
    
# After action
plan.update_step(step_num, "completed", observation_summary)

# Check progress
progress = plan.check_plan()
if progress["all_steps_completed"]:
    synthesize_solution()
```

4. Update IT Manager and Service Desk Manager agents

    def query_similar_issues(self, current_issue):
        """Find similar past issues"""
        # Search memory graph
        # Return similar issues with resolutions
        pass
        
    def learn_pattern(self, issue_type, successful_approach):
        """Store successful diagnostic pattern"""
        # Create pattern entity
        # Link to successful tools/approaches
        # Add observations about effectiveness
        pass
```

3. Integrate with Investigation Logger:
```python

            branch_a = self.think_branch("Hypothesis A", branch_id="netw")
            branch_b = self.think_branch("Hypothesis B", branch_id="app")
            
        # Revise based on findings
        if branch_a["evidence"] == "weak":
            revised = self.revise_thought(
                thought_number=2,
