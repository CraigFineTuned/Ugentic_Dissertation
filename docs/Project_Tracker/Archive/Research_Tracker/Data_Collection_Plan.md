# DATA COLLECTION PLAN (v2)

**Version:** 2.0 (Revolutionary Integration Update)

---

## 1. **RESEARCH QUESTIONS (v2)**

1.  How can the Ubuntu philosophy be modeled into a computational framework to improve collective decision-making in business departments?
2.  Does a system of dialogue-based consensus, **augmented by a shared toolkit (MCP) and grounded in documents (RAG)**, lead to higher quality and more trusted decisions?
3.  What is the impact of the UGENTIC framework on decision-making speed, resource allocation, and stakeholder alignment in a real-world SME environment?
4.  **How does the availability of concrete tools influence the nature of the dialogue between agents?**

## 3. **DATA COLLECTION PHASES (v2)**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Implementation (Baseline)**
*   **Timeline:** September 15-30, 2025
*   **Activities:**
    1.  Conduct initial interviews with all participating department heads to understand the current decision-making process (`AS-IS` state).
    2.  Gather 3-6 months of historical KPI data.

### **Phase 2: During Implementation (Case Studies)**
*   **Timeline:** October 1 - November 15, 2025
*   **Activities:**
    1.  For each of the 3-5 targeted case study decisions:
        *   The UGENTIC system will automatically log all agent dialogues, **tool calls**, and **RAG retrievals**.
        *   Key metrics (time to decision, etc.) will be automatically recorded.
    2.  Conduct brief, post-decision interviews with participants to gather immediate feedback on the tool-assisted workflow.

### **Phase 3: Post-Implementation (Evaluation)**
*   **Timeline:** November 15-30, 2025
*   **Activities:**
    1.  Conduct final, in-depth interviews with all participants to discuss their overall experience, **focusing on the perceived value of the MCP tools and RAG system**.
    2.  Analyze the complete, integrated dataset (dialogue, tool usage, KPIs).
    3.  Administer a final survey to quantify satisfaction and alignment.

## 4. **ETHICS & CONFIDENTIALITY**

(This section remains unchanged.)

*   **Informed Consent:** All participants will sign a consent form clearly outlining the research purpose, data usage, and their right to withdraw.
*   **Anonymity:** All data will be anonymized.
*   **Data Storage:** All data will be stored on an encrypted drive and will be destroyed after the dissertation is approved.
