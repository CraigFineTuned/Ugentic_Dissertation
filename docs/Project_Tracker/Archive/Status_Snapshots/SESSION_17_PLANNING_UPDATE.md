## 🎯 PLANNING FILE HIERARCHY

```
SESSION_ENTRY.md (Foundation - Entry point for every session)
  ↓
CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md (Dynamic - Current progress)
  ↓
SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (Historical - Session outcomes)
  ├─ SESSION_17_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (Latest)
  └─ SESSION_15_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (Previous)
```

**How It Works:**
1. **SESSION_ENTRY.md** - Read this first every session
2. **CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md** - Shows current status and next actions
3. **SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Links to completed session details
4. **SESSION_XX_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Detailed session documentation

## 🚀 NEXT SESSION PREPARATION

**When You Start Next Session:**

1. **Read:** `SESSION_ENTRY.md` (as always)
2. **Check:** `CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` (see current status)
3. **Review:** `SESSION_17_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (if needed)
4. **Decide:** Choose Option A, B, or C for next direction

**Options Available:**

## 📋 CRITICAL REMINDERS

**For Next Session:**
1. ✅ Always start with SESSION_ENTRY.md
2. ✅ User runs all tests manually (never assume automation)
3. ✅ Avoid DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC/ directory
4. ✅ Use docs/Project_Tracker/ for system planning
5. ✅ Update checkpoint file as work progresses

**Planning File Protocol:**
- Read SESSION_ENTRY.md first
- Update CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md dynamically
- Create SESSION_XX_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md at session end
- Update SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md with new session link
