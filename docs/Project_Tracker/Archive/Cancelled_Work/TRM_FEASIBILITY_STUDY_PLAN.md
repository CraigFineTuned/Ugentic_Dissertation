## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This component evaluates **Samsung's Tiny Recursive Model (TRM)** for potential integration into the UGENTIC system. TRM represents a breakthrough in AI efficiency - a 7 million parameter model that outperforms much larger models (including Gemini 2.5 Pro) on reasoning benchmarks through recursive refinement.

**Potential Impact:**
- Massive compute cost reduction (571x smaller model)
- Self-correcting agent reasoning
- Novel dissertation contribution (first enterprise TRM evaluation)

## BACKGROUND: WHAT IS TRM?

### Technical Overview

**Samsung's Tiny Recursive Model (TRM):**

- **Method:** Recursive refinement - draft answer â†’ refine up to 16x â†’ final output
- **Performance:** Outperforms Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek R1, o3-mini on reasoning benchmarks
- **License:** MIT open-source
- **Release Date:** October 7, 2025 (6 days ago)
- **Repository:** GitHub - Samsung Research

### Benchmark Performance

**ARC-AGI Reasoning:**
- TRM: 45% accuracy (ARC-AGI-1)
