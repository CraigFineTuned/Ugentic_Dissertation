## Core Directives (The Unchanging Rules)

*   **Avoid `DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC`:** All files and directories within `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC` are off-limits.
*   **Planning is Key:** All work is driven by the planning files in `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\docs`.
*   **The Golden Thread:** The starting point for every session is `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\docs\Project_Tracker\SESSION_ENTRY.md`. This file initiates the dynamic planning and update process.
*   **Manual Testing Only:** I will never run any tests. You are in full control of all testing.

## Summary of Our Last Session (Session 11)

**Primary Goal:** Enhance and Integrate the Specialized Knowledge Base.

**Key Accomplishments:**

*   **New Knowledge Base Created:** We created a new, structured `knowledge_base` directory to house all the specialized knowledge for our AI agents.
*   **Full Integration:**
    *   The new knowledge base is now officially part of the project, as documented in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.
    *   The AI agents will now use this new knowledge base, as `app.py` has been updated to point to the new directory.
*   **Logging System Fixed:** We identified and fixed a bug in the logging configuration, so the application will now correctly write logs to the `logs` directory.
*   **Dependencies Updated:** The `requirements.txt` file has been updated with a complete list of all project dependencies.
*   **All Changes Saved:** All our work has been pushed to your GitHub repository.

## Current State and Next Steps

*   **Current Status:** We are in the middle of "Session 11 - Knowledge Base Enhancement".
*   **Our Immediate Next Task:** Our next action, as documented in `CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md`, is to begin populating the new knowledge base documents. We will start with the **Application Support Playbook**.
