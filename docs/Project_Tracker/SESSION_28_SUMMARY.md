# SESSION 28 SUMMARY - Model Comparison Testing

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Time:** 07:40 - 08:00  
**Duration:** ~20 minutes  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Deepseek Recommended for Phase 3

---

## Executive Summary

Session 28 tested granite4:tiny-h as an alternative to deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud. Testing revealed that while the system is model-agnostic and can work with different LLMs, tiny models are unsuitable for production use due to severe performance degradation (8x slower), JSON parsing errors that break orchestration, and quality issues. **Recommendation: Use deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud for Phase 3 expert validation.**

---

## Objective

Test if granite4:tiny-h (a much smaller, faster-loading model) could be used as an alternative to deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud while maintaining acceptable quality and performance for Phase 3 expert validation.

---

## Testing Timeline

### Attempt 1: Invalid Config (07:40)

**Problem:**
```
‚ö† Warning: config.json is invalid JSON: 
Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 2 column 45 (char 46)
Using default configuration
```

**Cause:** JavaScript-style comments (`//`) in JSON file are invalid

**Result:** System fell back to default configuration (deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud)

**Lesson:** JSON does not support comments - must use pure JSON syntax

---

### Attempt 2: Valid Config (07:49)

**Config Used:**
```json
{
  "reasoning_model": "granite4:tiny-h",
  "embedding_model": "embeddinggemma:latest",
  "fast_model": "gemma3n:e4b"
}
```

**Verification:**
```
‚úì Configuration loaded from config.json
üß† Standard Mode: Using granite4:tiny-h
‚úì Initializing LLM: granite4:tiny-h
  Model: granite4:tiny-h
  Ready for inference
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Model loaded successfully, testing proceeded

## Test Cases Executed

### Test 1: Printer Issue (Sarah Chen)

**Input:**
```
User Sarah Chen in Building B can't print to the networked printer. 
She can connect to it but documents won't print. What's wrong?
```

**Type:** Ubuntu Orchestration (IT Support ‚Üí Infrastructure)  
**Iterations:** 2 (Infrastructure agent)  
**Response Time:** ~90s

**Root Cause (Granite):**
```
The root cause of the unknown problem appears to be a database connection 
error, as evidenced by the 'DatabaseConnect' error type logged at timestamp 
2025-10-17T07:54:05.513093. This suggests that either the print spooler 
service or an associated application/service is attempting to connect to a 
database but is unable to establish a valid connection...
```

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Says "unknown problem" (odd phrasing)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Focuses on database errors rather than printer permissions
- ‚úÖ Provides specific timestamp and error type
- ‚ùå Less accurate than deepseek version

**Solution (Granite):**
```python
['1. Verify that the print spooler service and associated applications...
 2. Check network connectivity between the system running the print spooler...
 3. Restart the print spooler service and monitor for recurrence...
 4. If the problem continues, examine the database server itself...
 5. Check system event logs and print spooler logs...']
```

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)
- ‚úÖ 5 actionable steps
- ‚úÖ No placeholders
- ‚ùå Formatted as Python list (unprofessional)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less specific than deepseek

**Comparison with Deepseek (Session 27):**
```
Root Cause (Deepseek): The user 'default_user' lacks proper authentication 
and authorization permissions to access the print queue on the networked 
printer (IP: 192.168.1.157) due to a multi-domain configuration issue, 
where user credentials and printer access rights are managed across 
different domains without proper synchronization.
```

**Verdict:** Deepseek identified the actual problem (permissions), granite focused on incorrect issue (database)

---

### Test 2: Finance App

**Input:**
```
Finance department reports that the expense reporting application crashes 
immediately on startup for all users in that department. System logs show 
permission errors.
```

**Type:** Solo Investigation (App Support)  
**Iterations:** 2  
**Response Time:** ~90s

**Root Cause (Granite):**
```
The root cause of the unknown problem appears to be an error within the 
'default_app' application. The query_app_logs command returned 57 total 
entries, but an unusually high number of errors (24) and warnings were 
logged within a single hour timeframe for the specified Finance department 
user. This suggests a software issue or misconfiguration causing abnormal 
behavior in the default application for this particular user.
```

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3/5)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Again says "unknown problem"
- ‚úÖ Identifies high error count (24 errors)
- ‚ùå Generic compared to deepseek
- ‚ùå Misses multi-domain authentication issue

**Solution (Granite):**
```python
['1. Investigate the specific error logs to identify the exact cause...
 2. Check if there were any recent changes or updates made...
 3. If possible, reproduce the issue by having the user attempt...
 4. Temporarily disable or uninstall any recently installed plugins...
 5. If the error persists... consider reaching out to vendor...']
```

**Rating:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)
- ‚úÖ 5 actionable steps
- ‚úÖ Logical progression
- ‚ùå Python list formatting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Generic compared to deepseek

**Comparison with Deepseek (Session 27):**
```
Root Cause (Deepseek): A multi-domain authentication issue caused by a 
corrupted user profile record where the email address field was truncated 
during storage, creating an invalid authentication token that the expense 
application could not process, leading to permission errors and crashes 
on startup.
```

**Verdict:** Deepseek provided detailed technical diagnosis, granite was generic

Failed: 1 (orchestration coordination error)
Orchestrations Attempted: 1 (33%)
Avg Response Time: 97.83s
```

---

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Performance: Unacceptable ‚ùå

**Observation:**
- Granite4:tiny-h: 97.83s average response time
- Deepseek: 12.33s average response time
- **8x slower than target**

**Impact:**
- Completely unusable for real-world scenarios
- User would abandon system during long waits
- Not suitable for expert demonstration

**Cause:**

- Generates tokens much slower
- More correction cycles needed

---

### 2. JSON Parsing Errors ‚ùå

**Observation:**
```
ERROR:root: Error in collaboration detection: Invalid control character at: 
line 4 column 449 (char 506)
```

**Impact:**
- Breaks Ubuntu orchestration coordination
- Reduces orchestration rate to 33% (vs 83% with deepseek)
- Multi-agent collaboration fails

**Cause:**

- System falls back to solo investigation mode

---

### 3. Output Formatting Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Observation:**
Solutions displayed as Python lists:
```python
['1. Step one...', '2. Step two...', '3. Step three...']
```

Should be formatted text:
```
1. Step one...
2. Step two...
3. Step three...
```

**Impact:**
- Unprofessional appearance
- Python array syntax visible to users
- Not suitable for expert demonstration
- Suggests LLM synthesis is partially broken

**Cause:**
- Tiny model's text generation less sophisticated
- May be returning data structures instead of formatted text
- LLM synthesis method not handling tiny model output correctly

---

### 4. Quality Degradation ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Observations:**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Less accurate (focuses on wrong issues)
- Uses phrase "unknown problem" repeatedly
- Misses complex technical details (multi-domain, authentication)
- More generic explanations

**Solution Quality:**
- Less specific recommendations
- More generic troubleshooting steps
- Still actionable but not as targeted

**Example:**
- Deepseek: "multi-domain configuration issue where user credentials and printer access rights are managed across different domains without proper synchronization"
- Granite: "database connection error... unable to establish a valid connection"

**Impact:**
- Lower diagnostic accuracy
- Less helpful for actual troubleshooting
- Would reduce confidence during expert validation
