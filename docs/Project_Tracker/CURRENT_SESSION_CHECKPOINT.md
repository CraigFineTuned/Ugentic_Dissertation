## üö® CRITICAL STRATEGIC REALIGNMENT

### **What Changed This Session**

**User provided dissertation proposal revealing actual research mission:**

- **Action:** Note for post-graduation exploration

**2. Deep Agents / Agents 2.0 (Phil Schmid)**
- **Relevance:** ‚úÖ VALIDATION (confirms your architecture follows best practices)
- **Action:** Can cite in dissertation as architectural validation

**3. VentureBeat - 100x Faster Reasoning**
- **Relevance:** ‚ùå NOT RELEVANT (model efficiency ‚â† Ubuntu validation)
- **Action:** Ignore for dissertation

**4. Scalable Multi-Agent AI for Operational Intelligence**
- **Relevance:** ‚úÖ POTENTIALLY USEFUL (could inform RQ6 transferability)
- **Action:** Optional reference for implementation methodology

**5. MCP Tutorial**
- **Relevance:** ‚úÖ ALREADY USING (your system uses MCP)
- **Action:** Reference only if MCP issues arise

**6. Local Files (servers-main)**
- **What:** Official MCP reference implementations
- **Relevance:** ‚úÖ REFERENCE (MCP best practices)
- **Action:** Consult if MCP optimization needed

**7. Local Files (elysia-main)**
- **What:** Alternative agentic framework (decision trees)
- **Relevance:** ‚ö†Ô∏è VERY LOW (different approach, post-dissertation)
- **Action:** Explore after graduation

## ‚ùå WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING

### **Cancelled: Component 1 - TRM Feasibility Study**

**Original Plan:** Evaluate Samsung's Tiny Recursive Model for UGENTIC integration

**Why Cancelled:**
1. ‚ùå TRM is about model efficiency, not Ubuntu collaboration
2. ‚ùå Doesn't address any of your 6 research questions
3. ‚ùå Doesn't help validate cultural philosophy integration
4. ‚ùå Would consume 10-15 hours needed for dissertation
5. ‚ùå Not mentioned in dissertation proposal
6. ‚ùå Not required for graduation

**TRM Addresses:** Efficient reasoning with 7M parameter models
**Your Dissertation Addresses:** Ubuntu philosophy in multi-agent collaboration

**These are orthogonal research directions.**
