# SESSION 22 - CHECKPOINT UPDATE: ARCHITECTURAL FIX COMPLETE

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Session Status:** ✅ **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FIX IMPLEMENTED**  
**Previous Issue:** 38-minute Test 1 duration  
**Root Cause Identified:** ask_questions tool disconnected from RAG  
**Fix Applied:** Complete RAG integration for support_tools  

---

## Summary of Changes

### What Was Wrong
The `ask_questions` tool in IT Support was a mock implementation that:
- Used pattern matching instead of querying knowledge base
- Returned generic templates for unmatched questions  
- Caused IT Support agents to loop indefinitely on varied questions
- Session 21's threshold increase (3→5) made this worse by allowing longer loops

### What Was Fixed
**Architecture:** ask_questions now connects to RAG knowledge base

**Changes Made:**
1. Modified `src/ugentic/tools/support_tools.py`:
   - Added global RAG system reference
   - Rewrote ask_questions to query RAG for real answers
   - Implemented graceful fallback when RAG doesn't match
   - Added _get_fallback_answer() for missing content

2. Modified `app.py`:
   - Added import for set_rag_system
   - Connected RAG system to tools during initialization
   - Added console confirmation

### Why This Matters
- **Before:** Agent asks "Can user access resources?" → template response → asks again → loop
- **After:** Agent asks "Can user access resources?" → RAG retrieves policy → real answer → makes progress

## Ready for Re-Testing

All code modifications complete. System ready for:
1. Re-run Test 1 (same input as before)
2. Measure duration (expect 2-3 min vs 38 min)
3. Verify improved agent progression
