# TOKEN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (v1.0)

**Purpose:** To maintain high performance and reduce cost by optimizing token usage.

## Core Principles

1.  **Be Concise:** Provide the minimum necessary context. Summarize where possible.
2.  **Reference, Don't Repeat:** Instead of pasting large files, reference their file paths. The AI can read them if needed.
3.  **Clean Checkpoints:** Keep the `CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` focused on actionable goals and logs. Move large data or notes to separate, referenced files.
4.  **Summarize History:** The `SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` should be a high-level overview, not a detailed transcript.
