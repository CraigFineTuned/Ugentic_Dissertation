## INSTRUCTIONS FOR GEMINI

When this file is provided, follow these steps in order:

**Step 0: Verify & Recover**
- Read `CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` to detect forced cutoffs.
- Re-verify completed actions based on the `CONTINUOUS_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md`.
- If verification fails, mark the last action as incomplete and resume from there.

**Step 1: Read Context**
- Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to load the project's vision, goals, and alignment.

**Step 2: Read Last Summary**
- Read `SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` to understand the outcome of the previous session.

**Step 3: Execute Next Action**
- Identify the next incomplete action from the checkpoint file.
- Execute it with discretion. Create files, write code, update documents.
- Only confirm with the user when their input is explicitly required.
