### Test Results: Session 20251017_083652

**Configuration Used:**
```json
{
  "reasoning_model": "deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud",
  "embedding_model": "embeddinggemma:latest",
  "fast_model": "gemma3n:e4b"
}
```

**Session Metrics:**
```
Session ID: 20251017_083652
Total User Cases: 2 (printer issue, finance app)
Total Investigations: 5 (includes retry cycles)
Successful: 2 (100% user case completion)

```

---

### Test Case 1: Printer Issue (Sarah Chen) ‚úÖ PERFECT

**Flow:**
```
IT Manager ‚Üí IT Support (solo) ‚Üí 2 iterations ‚Üí ROOT CAUSE FOUND
```

**Quality Assessment:**

| Aspect | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Delegation | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Correctly routed to IT Support |
| Tool Selection | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | check_printer_status ‚Üí check_user_permissions |
| Tool Diversity | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | No repetition (Session 23 fix working) |
| Efficiency | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | 2 iterations - optimal |
| Root Cause | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Detailed with IP, permission status specifics |
| Solution | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | 6 actionable steps, professional |

**Root Cause Output:**
```
"The user with ID 'default_user' does not have the necessary permissions 
to access the networked printer (IP: 192.168.1.157). The printer itself 
is online, has paper, and is functioning correctly with jobs in its queue, 
but the user's permission check returned 'has_access: False' and a 
'permission_level' of 'None'."
```

**Solution Output:**
```
1. Log into the print server or Active Directory system managing printer permissions.
2. Locate the user account for 'default_user'.
3. Navigate to the security or permissions settings for the printer...
4. Add the 'default_user' account to the list of users with permissions...
5. Assign an appropriate permission level, such as 'Print'.
6. Save the changes and instruct the user to attempt printing again.
```

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **Session 27 fix verified - detailed solo summary**

---

### Test Case 2: Finance Expense App ‚úÖ DISSERTATION GOLD

**Flow:**
```
IT Manager ‚Üí App Support ‚Üí COLLABORATION NEEDED ‚Üí Infrastructure orchestrates
‚Üí Infrastructure, IT Support, App Support all participate
‚Üí Ubuntu synthesis executed ‚Üí Excellent multi-domain result
```

**Quality Assessment:**

| Aspect | Rating | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Collaboration Detection | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | App Support correctly identified complexity |
| Agent Participation | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | 3 agents: Infrastructure, IT Support, App Support |
| Ubuntu Synthesis | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | **DISSERTATION GOLD** - proves collective intelligence |
| Root Cause Quality | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Multi-domain technical narrative |
| Solution Quality | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | 4-step comprehensive approach |
| Ubuntu Value | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Compelling philosophy statement |

**Ubuntu Synthesis Output:**

**Root Cause:**
```
"A multi-domain issue, likely stemming from an HR system integration 
or Active Directory synchronization problem, resulted in incomplete 
and corrupted user profile data (specifically truncated at the 'ac' 
attribute) for all users in the finance department. This corrupted 
data caused the application to crash on startup due to permission 
errors when it attempted to parse the malformed user profiles."
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Immediate Mitigation: Temporarily grant standard, non-corrupted 
   profile permissions to finance users to restore application access.
2. Data Correction: Identify and repair the corrupted user profile 
   entries in Active Directory, specifically completing the truncated 
   'ac' attribute.
3. Process Fix: Investigate and resolve the underlying HR/Active 
   Directory synchronization process to prevent future profile corruption.
4. Application Resilience: Update the expense application's code to 
   handle malformed user profiles more gracefully (e.g., with default 
   values or clear error messages) instead of crashing.
```

**Ubuntu Value Statement:**
```
"The collective approach prevented a siloed response. Without collaboration, 
Infrastructure might have only checked domain trust, IT Support may have 
just tried to recreate a single user profile, and App Support might have 
wasted time debugging application code. Together, they connected the 
infrastructure-level cause to the data-level symptom and the 
application-level effect, leading to a complete and accurate diagnosis."
```

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **DISSERTATION GOLD - Proves Ubuntu philosophy enhances multi-agent collaboration**

## SESSION 28 - MODEL TESTING COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### Model Comparison Testing (07:40 - 08:00)

**Objective:** Test granite4:tiny-h as alternative to deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud

**Session Metrics (Granite Tiny):**
```
Session ID: 20251017_074920
Total Investigations: 3
Successful: 2 (67%)
