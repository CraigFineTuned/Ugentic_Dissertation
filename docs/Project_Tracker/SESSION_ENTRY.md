## CRITICAL RULES (READ FIRST)

**Before creating/deleting/editing ANY file, internalize these rules:**

1. ‚ùå **AVOID:** All files in `DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC/` (separate academic project)
2. ‚úÖ **USE:** Planning files in `docs/Project_Tracker/` only
3. üéØ **FOUNDATION:** This file (`SESSION_ENTRY.md`) is the single entry point
4. üîÑ **DYNAMIC:** Read and update checkpoint files as work progresses
5. üß™ **TESTING:** User runs all tests manually - never assume or suggest automation
6. ‚úã **VERIFY:** Before modifying planning files, verify against checkpoint that it's the correct action

**Planning Structure Hierarchy:**
```
SESSION_ENTRY.md (you are here)
  ‚Üì
CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md (what's happening now)
  ‚Üì
PROJECT_CONTEXT.md (static context)
  ‚Üì
SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (history)
```

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANT

When this file is provided, follow these steps in order:

**Step 0: Verify & Recover**
- Read `CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` to detect forced cutoffs.
- Re-verify completed actions based on the `CONTINUOUS_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md`.
- If verification fails, mark the last action as incomplete and resume from there.

**Step 1: Read Context**
- Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to load the project's vision, goals, and alignment.

**Step 2: Read Last Summary**
- Read `SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` to understand the outcome of the previous session.

**Step 3: Execute Next Action**
- Identify the next incomplete action from the checkpoint file.
- Execute it with discretion. Create files, write code, update documents.
- Only confirm with the user when their input is explicitly required.
