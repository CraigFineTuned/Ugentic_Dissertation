	
	 Choosing a Research Topic 
	When choosing your topic, you should identify the broad area of study and make a list of all possible topics. You may also have an idea of what you want to do, but investigate all possibilities before your decide. You should give yourself plenty of options and then select the one that works best for you. Your research topic should be something that you are particularly interested in. It is important that you read a variety of research and articles in your field to draw insights and become more informed in your area of research. 
	Do some brainstorming as a method of getting a large number of ideas relating to a specific area of interest, keeping in mind the requirements for both your dissertation proposal and the rest of the chapters. 
	
	A strong research topic is a focused topic. You should have a clear focused and a worthwhile problem and determine if the scope of the research is appropriate to the degree and does the topic have the potential to make an original contribution. You should start off with an idea of a clear question or problem that can be explored and make a significant impact on the knowledge in your particular discipline. Ask yourself why do I want to study this topic? 
	
	Ask yourself if your topic is manageable? You should ensure that your topic is not too broad, nor too narrow. 
	Will I be able to collect data and are there organisations and companies where I will be able to collect data based on this topic? 
	Ask yourself if this topic is feasible? You will have to determine whether or not the topic you are proposing is manageable within the time-frame. 
	Listen to ideas – it is your choice if you use them or not. It is quite likely that the title of the research will change as you gain more knowledge and understanding. Ensure that you have thoroughly done the background research for your idea, so that you don’t waste time chopping and changing at an advanced stage in your research. 
	It is always a good idea to generate several possible research questions and then choose the best one as every research question has strengths and weaknesses. 
	Ensure that you can make a good dissertation about the problem as you need to be able to convince others of the novelty of the topic. 
	
	Choosing the Title 
• There is no real formula for identifying a meaningful title. The title describes the scope of the research. Choose a title that captures the essence of your proposed project. 
• The title should accurately describe the exact nature of the main element of the study. 
• The title must be informative and relevant and should capture the attention of the reader. 
• The title should not be too long (normally not more than 10 words) but should provide as much information about the study as possible. 
• The title should preferably not be in a question form; it must define the research clearly, and must be clear and precise. 
• The title should not contain technical terms, or jargon. The use of acronyms should be limited.

xxviii	Abstract 
xxix	The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its integration into smart cities has fuelled substantial research interest over the past decade. This study employs bibliometric analysis techniques to comprehensively explore the landscape of IoT and smart cities research, focusing exclusively on Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) articles published in English from 2013 to 2023. The Scopus database serves as the primary data source for this analysis. 
xxx	The study employs three key analysis tools: VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Microsoft Excel, to extract and visualize patterns, trends, and impactful research within this domain. VOSviewer will be utilized for co-authorship and co-citation network analysis, providing insights into collaboration dynamics among researchers and the most influential authors and institutions. CiteSpace will help identify emerging research themes, core articles, and the evolution of knowledge domains. Microsoft Excel will support quantitative analysis, enabling the examination of publication trends, citation counts, and the identification of key research clusters. 
xxxi	By applying these bibliometric tools to IEEE articles within the specified timeframe and language constraints, this study aims to uncover the evolution of IoT and smart cities research, prominent research clusters, and influential scholars. The findings will contribute valuable insights into the development and current state of this dynamic field, informing future research directions and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration in the quest for smarter and more sustainable urban environments.

The integration of IoT technology in urban environments has garnered significant attention, mostly due to its promise to transform cities into smart, efficient, and sustainable entities.. This survey of the literature attempts to offer an overview of the IoT, its implications for urban environments, and perspectives from diverse authors on this game-changing technology. 
ccclxxviii	In order to implement IoT in urban settings, various infrastructures must be equipped with sensors and communication devices that allow for data gathering and processing (Rai, 2023). Cities may increase sustainability, public services, resource allocation, and economic growth with IoT. 
ccclxxix	IoT has the potential to enable smart cities by giving city planners access to real-time data, according to Alahi et al. (2023). They talk about how IoT may improve healthcare, waste management, energy use, and traffic management, which will ultimately result in better resource management and a higher standard of living. Park (2018) provides a thorough summary of IoT technologies, uses, and difficulties. The primary objectives of their efforts revolve around enhancing urban sustainability, reducing energy consumption, and fostering a cleaner environment by employing intelligent resource management strategies, hence underscoring the need of smart cities based on the IoT. 
ccclxxx	Hassebo & Tealab (2023) have examined IoT's contributions to the urban environment, particularly around the area of smart cities. They go over the many IoT applications, such as smart grid systems, smart transportation, and smart healthcare, highlighting the importance of effective data management and security to fully reap the rewards. IoT-enabled smart cities are thoroughly examined by Syed et al. (2021), who also highlight the many parties and components involved. In order to produce sustainable, liveable urban places, they emphasize the significance of a holistic strategy that incorporates technologies, policies, and public interaction. 
ccclxxxi	Although all experts agree that IoT has the ability to transform urban areas into "smart cities," their viewpoints differ in terms of depth and emphasis. Hassebo & Tealab (2023) 
ccclxxxii	14 
ccclxxxiii	highlight a variety of applications, while Alahi et al. (2023) primarily concentrate on practical applications and real-time data utilization. Syed et al. (2021) emphasize the significance of a holistic approach involving multiple stakeholders for successful implementation. 
ccclxxxiv	The potential for creating smart cities through IoT integration in urban settings is enormous. The ability of IoT to revolutionize how resources are managed, advance sustainability, and enhance quality of life is widely acknowledged by authors. For the IoT to be deployed effectively in the urban environment, it is necessary to take into account a multidimensional strategy that includes technology, policy, and citizen involvement. For IoT to fully contribute to the construction of smarter, more sustainable cities, additional research and practical applications are required. 
ccclxxxv	2.1.1. Key Components and Technologies: 
ccclxxxvi	In his complete proposal, Gillis (2023) identifies four essential building pieces for IoT systems: sensing, communication, data processing, and action. They emphasize the significance of sensors for gathering data, communication networks for transmitting data, data analytics for drawing conclusions, and actuators for implementing changes in response to the conclusions drawn. According to Douzis et al. (2018), integrating cloud computing and IoT is a crucial step in creating smart cities. They talk about how cloud computing makes it possible to store and handle massive volumes of data produced by IoT devices in a scalable manner, enabling resource optimization and real-time decision-making in urban environments. 
ccclxxxvii	Fog computing is emphasized by Zahmatkesh and Al-Turjman (2020) as a key technology in IoT-based smart cities. They explain how extending cloud capabilities to the network's edge with fog computing which enables quicker data processing and lowers latency. This is especially important for applications that require quick responses in smart city settings. The communication standards and protocols required for IoT deployment in smart cities are discussed by Mansour et al. (2023). The need for established protocols to promote smooth communication and interoperability among IoT devices is emphasized as they explore several communication methods, including Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID), Near-Field Communication (NFC), and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6). 
ccclxxxviii	15 
ccclxxxix	While the basic elements like sensing, connectivity, and data processing are shared by all writers, their emphasis on integrating cloud and fog computing varies. Gillis gives a thorough description of the fundamental elements, whereas Douzis et al. (2018) concentrates on integrating cloud computing, Zahmatkesh & Al-Turjman (2020) emphasizes the value of fog computing, and Mansour et al. (2023) emphasizes the significance of standardized communication protocols.

dcxxxiii	Chapter Four: Research Methodology 
dcxxxiv	4.1. Research Design: 
dcxxxv	Bibliometric analysis is a methodological approach that straddles the line between quantitative and qualitative research, depending on its application. At its core, bibliometric analysis is fundamentally quantitative, as it involves the statistical analysis of books, articles, and other scholarly publications. The primary objective of bibliometric analysis is to quantitatively evaluate aspects such as the impact of a research field, the evolution of a discipline, or the contributions of individual researchers. 
dcxxxvi	In terms of quantitative aspects, bibliometric analysis focuses on measuring various elements of scholarly literature. This includes publication counts, citation analysis, authorship patterns, and co-citation analysis (Ellegaard & Wallin, 2015). It typically requires the use of comprehensive databases and software tools to gather and analyze large sets of bibliographic data. Through these analyses, bibliometric methods can uncover trends, patterns, and networks within scientific research, and are frequently employed to map the research landscape of a specific field (Zupic & Čater, 2015). 
dcxxxvii	While predominantly quantitative, bibliometric analysis can also offer qualitative insights, particularly when integrated with content analysis. This approach can help identify key themes, major contributors, and seminal works within a research area, providing a richer understanding of the field’s developmental trajectory and intellectual structure (Cobo et al., 2011). 
dcxxxviii	Bibliometric analysis has become an invaluable tool in fields such as library and information science, but its utility extends across various disciplines. It is widely used for analyzing research trends, assessing the impact of research, and guiding future research directions. The methodology offers a comprehensive view of the academic landscape, helping to pinpoint influential studies and emerging topics of interest (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017). 
dcxxxix	The examination of the connections between the various study components, the bibliometric approach analyzes bibliometric data using quantitative methodologies and describes the subject's bibliometric and intellectual structure (Donthu et al., 2021). According to Block and Fisch (2020), this data can be utilized to highlight the contributions of many disciplines, spot trends and open gaps. In order to ascertain the 
dcxl	48 
dcxli	conceptual evolution of the research topic, it thus offers both a scientific mapping and an analysis of the performance of IoT and Smart Cities (Donthu et al., 2021). 
dcxlii	Bibliometric analysis is a great option for this study since it can quantitatively evaluate the dynamics and influence of the research environment. Bibliometrics can provide important insights into the emergence of research trends (Donthu et al., 2021). The influence of significant individuals, and the interconnection of scholars and institutions by examining citation patterns, publication trends, and collaboration networks. This method will support resource allocation and strategic decision-making by assisting in the identification of significant works and collaborations, as well as in understanding the historical development of the subject. The data-driven nature of bibliometric analysis makes it a crucial tool for fulfilling the study's goals because it will give an impartial basis for judging the importance of research contributions. 
dcxliii	In this study, a procedure was designed to choose the search terms, pick the right database, set the search criteria, pick the analysis program, and evaluate the results. The steps are shown in Figure 4.1. below, and they are further explained in the paragraphs that follow. 
dcxliv	Figure 4.2: Breakdown of steps for bibliometric analysis. 
dcxlv	49 
dcxlvi	4.2. Data Collection: 
dcxlvii	The Scopus database will be used to gain the selected data set. Scopus is a comprehensive, highly maintained abstract and citation database, enriched data, and connected scholarly literature from a wide range of fields are all combined in a singular way by Scopus (Elsevier, 2023a). Scopus locates credible research fast, recognizes experts, and gives users access to trustworthy data, analytics, and analytical tools. The selected data extracted from the Scopus database will be searched by the term, “internet of things” OR IoT OR IOT AND “smart cit*”. This string search was used to include all abbreviations of Internet of Things and uses a wildcard (*) to identify “smart city” or “smart cities” in the search. This is done to ensure that all relevant articles will be searched for. The search data will be filtered to limit the year range between 2013 and 2023. The document type will be limited to articles only, to ensure that verified content is used. The source type will be journals that are published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The language will also be limited to articles published in the English language. 
dcxlviii	The reason for choosing the period from 20th August 2023 to 10th September 2023 is the need to effectively capture the changing research landscape while maintaining a balance between historical depth and current relevance: The chosen period of ten years makes it possible to understand the historical development of the topic. This period is broad enough to capture the significant changes, pioneering work, and fundamental contributions that have shaped the development of the field over time (Dwivedi et al., 2023). The longer ten-year time frame allows us to identify ongoing trends and patterns that may not be apparent on shorter time scales. By observing the changes over many years, we can better understand the cyclicality of research topics, methodological changes and the emergence of new sub-areas (Huyler & McGill, 2019). 
dcxlix	Longer periods allow for a more accurate assessment of the impact of scientific articles. Citation metrics, which are often used to measure impact, take time to accumulate, and longer periods allow for a full appreciation of the work's importance to the scientific community (Reed et al., 2021). The period chosen covers both recent and historically influential work, avoiding the tendency to emphasize only recent publications. This balance provides a holistic account of the intellectual contributions of the field over time (Dwivedi et al., 2023). 
dcl	50 
dcli	The period corresponds to the availability and completeness of the data on publications and citations. Providing accurate and complete data is critical to generating reliable information (Loshin, 2011). The ten-year period strikes a balance between depth and manageability. It provides enough historical context without overloading your analysis with too much data (Dwivedi et al., 2021). 
dclii	Finally, the period from 20th August 2023 to 10th September 2023, was chosen to enable a well-founded analysis of the research landscape within the parameters of historical relevance, current relevance and practical feasibility (Dwivedi et al., 2023). This careful selection will enable the researcher to generate meaningful insights, identify trends and contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the development of the IoT and Smart cities.

dccxiv	This analysis provides valuable insights into the historical evolution of research activity within the chosen research area. It helps researchers and stakeholders understand how the field has developed, identify key milestones, and anticipate potential future trends (Mengist et al., 2020). 
dccxv	4.6. Citation Analysis: 
dccxvi	This study adopts the strategy of Citation Analysis and Impact Assessment, so researchers can get important insights on the significance of certain articles and their contributions to the growth of the IoT and smart city research fields. Researchers and decision-makers can detect trends, important writers, and important works that have greatly influenced the domain with the use of this approach (Rejeb et al., 2022). Compile a thorough dataset of publication records for the study topic of interest, including citation information. Bibliographical databases like Scopus, Web of Science, or Google Scholar are good sources for this dataset. To assess the impact of articles, select important citation metrics. 
dccxvii	54 
dccxviii	Total citations received, h-index, g-index, i-index, and average citations per manuscript are typical measures. 
dccxix	Define the precise parameters of the research area relating to "Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities." This guarantees that the analysis is limited to pertinent articles. Recognize highly cited works using the total number of citations obtained, and order the publications in your dataset from most to least cited. Construct visuals that illustrate citation patterns. Relationships between highly cited publications and other papers in the area can be seen visually using network graphs, citation maps, or co-citation matrices. For the purpose of identifying research themes and significant research clusters, examine groups of highly cited publications and the relationships between them. 
dccxx	Calculate and analyze various impact indicators for works that have received many citations. One indicator of production and influence is the h-index, which counts the number of papers with at least h citations. Analyze the g-index, which gives extra weight to highly cited works by taking the distribution of citations across papers into account. Examine the keywords and subjects that are frequently mentioned in these publications to find recurrent themes. Longevity and consistency assess highly referenced work that has been quoted over the period. A publication's lasting impact can be determined by the number of times that it has been cited. Analyze the consistency of the citations in various books. An article is considered extremely significant if it has a lasting impact on a variety of research fields. Comparative Analysis to determine the relative influence of highly cited works and other publications on the subject and compare them. Examine their impact on the growth of the research field in comparison to less-cited papers. Relate the results to the IoT and smart city industries. Describe how highly cited works affect research agendas, scholars' perspectives, and the body of knowledge within the area of research. 
dccxxi	4.7. Impact Assessment: 
dccxxii	To assess the influence and impact of research papers, bibliometric analysis usually uses a variety of citation measures. For a study on "Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities," the following citation metrics will be used, along with an explanation of their significance. Total citations count the number of times a publication has been referenced in other works to determine the overall influence of that publication. An article with a higher total citation count has likely attracted more interest and influence in the subject 
dccxxiii	55 
dccxxiv	(Yildiz, 2021). Citations per year show the influence and relevance of a publication. A publication with a high annual citation rate suggests that it will remain influential over time, whereas a diminishing trend can suggest that it is becoming less relevant (Yildiz, 2021). 
dccxxv	The h-index is a productivity and impact indicator. The maximum number of h for which an author has h publications, each with at least h citations, is the author's h-index. It aids in evaluating the overall impact of a writer's body of work (Shah & Jawaid, 2023). The g-index lends more weight to highly cited papers than the h-index does, although it is similar to it. It takes into account the distribution of citations across works, and it can be especially helpful for determining the most important works of a certain author or body of work (Schreiber, 2010). The i-index tracks the number of works with at least ten citations. It displays how influential a writer or researcher has been in creating work that has had an impact on the industry (Sangeeta, 2018). 
dccxxvi	The average number of citations per manuscript serves as a benchmark for the productivity and impact of a researcher or an institution. It makes it easier to determine the impact of their articles on the industry (Agarwal et al.,2016). Relative Citation Ratio (RCR) is a field-normalized statistic that is used to evaluate the influence of citations on specific publications. It is helpful for analyzing the influence of works across various sectors as it takes into account variances in citation habits among study fields (Hutchins et al., 2016). Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) is a different field-normalized statistic that contrasts the average citation impact in a given research field with the citation effect of individual publications (Purkayastha et al., 2019). 
dccxxvii	4.8. Network Analysis: 
dccxxviii	Analyzing co-authorship networks and institutional collaborations using VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Excel involves a combination of visualization and quantitative analysis. A network analysis can be done with each of these tools:

dcclxxvi	
dcclxxvii	4.12 Limitations: 
dcclxxviii	It is essential to acknowledge the potential limitations of the research methodology for bibliometric analysis, which involves using the Scopus database, filtering for IEEE articles published between 2013 and 2023 in English, and utilizing VOSviewer, Excel, and CiteSpace. 
dcclxxix	The Scopus database, while comprehensive, may not encompass all relevant publications within the IoT and smart cities domain. Some valuable research might be published in non-Scopus-indexed journals or conference proceedings. Limiting the analysis to IEEE 
dcclxxx	62 
dcclxxxi	articles may exclude relevant research from other reputable sources and could introduce a bias toward IEEE-focused research. Restricting the analysis of IEEE articles might introduce a publication bias, as IEEE publications may favour certain types of research or methodologies. This bias could affect the generalizability of findings. 
dcclxxxii	Focusing exclusively on articles in the English language may introduce a language bias, potentially excluding valuable contributions in other languages. This bias could impact the comprehensiveness of the analysis. The analysis covers a specific time frame from 2013 to 2023 and focuses on IEEE articles. The findings may not reflect developments and contributions before 2013 or after 2023, or those from non-IEEE sources. Findings may be more applicable to research within the scope of IEEE interests, which might differ from broader perspectives on IoT and smart cities. While Scopus is a reputable database, it may have its own limitations, such as incomplete coverage of certain publication types or variations in data quality across disciplines and journals. 
dcclxxxiii	The use of VOSviewer, Excel, and CiteSpace offers valuable analytical capabilities but may not capture all aspects of bibliometric analysis. The limitations of these tools, such as default settings or assumptions in algorithms, should be considered. Bibliometric analysis relies on citation data, which can have inherent limitations, including self-citations and variations in citation practices across fields. Interpreting collaboration patterns solely based on co-authorship and citations may not capture the full scope of research collaborations and impact. 
dcclxxxiv	The analysis should adhere to ethical guidelines for data usage, copyright compliance, and proper attribution, however, potential ethical issues may still arise in practice.

dccxci	Chapter Five: Data Analysis and Presentation 
dccxcii	As we stand on the brink of urban transformation, the concept of 'Smart Cities' has risen to prominence, propelled by the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies (Hollands 2008). This fusion is reshaping urban living, promising enhanced sustainability, efficiency, and a new calibre of urban experience. This chapter conducts a bibliometric analysis to dissect the extensive scholarly engagement with IoT-based smart citie. The aim is to reveal the research dynamics, collaboration networks, and thematic evolutions within this field (Batty et al. 2012). 
dccxciii	Bibliometric analysis offers a quantitative tool to navigate the vast seas of academic literature, allowing for the investigation of publication patterns, trend developments, and the impact of research within the domain of IoT and smart cities (Ellegaard and Wallin 2015). By charting the intellectual landscape, this analysis brings to light the key contributors, influential institutions, and the geographic epicenters of innovation, as well as the foundational theories and the cutting-edge topics that are driving the field's progression (Trabucchi and Buganza 2019; Caragliu, Del Bo, and Nijkamp 2011). 
dccxciv	Employing meticulous data collection and sophisticated analysis techniques, this chapter aims to offer a panoramic view of the current state of research by distilling the complex data into actionable insights and discernible patterns (Aria and Cuccurullo 2017). The resultant narrative provides a valuable resource for academics, policymakers, and industry professionals who are steering the course of urban development augmented by IoT innovations (Albino, Berardi, and Dangelico 2015). 
dccxcv	In recognition of the collective intellectual endeavor and the collaborative nature that underpins this domain, our bibliometric exploration stands as a homage to the ongoing scholarly discourse that is shaping the future of smart urban environments through IoT (Kitchin 2014; Leydesdorff and Milojević 2015). It is an exploration of the past, an analysis of the present, and a forward-looking perspective on the smart cities of tomorrow (Bibri and Krogstie 2017).

dccxcix	that can withstand the dynamism of urban environments (Zanella et al., 2014). By employing a diverse array of performance analysis techniques, ranging from data-driven analytics to simulation-based modelling, urban technologists can dissect complex systems, evaluate the efficacy of smart solutions, and predict future performance under varying conditions (Batty et al., 2012). Such methodologies not only enable the optimization of resources but also foster adaptive and resilient infrastructures capable of evolving with the city's changing needs (Bibri and Krogstie, 2017). In this vein, the forthcoming sections will explore the multifaceted approaches to performance analysis, each providing unique insights into the operational prowess of smart city initiatives and the tangible benefits they yield for urban dwellers (Caragliu, Del Bo, and Nijkamp, 2011).

4.	INTRODUCTION 
5.	Today, information technology (IT) serves as the backbone of most organisations (Dibbern, et al., 2004; Bourgeois, 2014). IT refers to the hardware and software used in facilitating the collection, storage and dissemination of data, information and knowledge (CSIT, 1995; Bourgeois, 2014). Almost every organization is dependent on IT in order to achieve their business objectives (Dibbern et al., 2004). This is because IT serves as an enabler of corporate strategies and a catalyst of change to the business models of various organisations (Applegate, Austin & Soule, 2009; Kumar, 2016). Different IT solutions have been developed, and they are evolving to enable organisations from different sectors meet their growing challenges successfully (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999). One of the sectors benefiting from the enabling feature of IT, is the manufacturing sector (CSIT, 1995). 
6.	The manufacturing sector consists of organisations (whether machine tools or consumer goods producing firms) that work towards producing “the right product, with the right quality, in the right quantity, at the right price, and at the right time” (Rana, 2013, p. 435). They also endeavor to satisfy their customers, who are the primary reason for their business operations (CSIT, 1995; Rana, 2013). In order to achieve an efficient and effective business operation, it is necessary that the appropriate information is received from customers and communicated to staff at the appropriate time, so as to make real time decisions (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999). The managers of manufacturing organisations have found it necessary to adopt technological systems, because they facilitate real time communication of business operation’s information (Rana, 2013). 
7.	IT in manufacturing organisations play a vital role in the sustenance and improvement of the business (Grant, 2000; Rana, 2013). Different functional units (such as account and finance, sales and marketing, manufacturing and production etc.) in manufacturing organisations use different types of IT systems and applications to enhance their business processes (CSIT, 1995). Examples of these IT systems and applications include: Database Management system (DBMS) (Rana, 2013), barcodes (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, and Enterprise resource planning (ERP) system (Askenäs & Westelius, 2000). The integration of IT into manufacturing technologies, have resulted in computer integrated solutions that are helping to restructure the manufacturing plant in becoming lean and efficient (Rana, 2013). Computer-integrated manufacturing, which came about as a result of the combination of factory automation and IT, is helping to improve manufacturing operations (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999). Organisations such as Boeing, Alley–Bradley and Black and Decker are using computer-integrated manufacturing to improve their manufacturing operations (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999; Rana, 2013). 
8.	Another important aspect that IT has helped, is the digitalisation of supply chain process (Eamonn & Kelly, 2015). Supply chain management is one amongst other essential functions for manufacturing organisations. This is because the success or competitiveness of a manufacturing organisation relies on how efficient and cost-effective the flow of resources (i.e. material, funds and information) moves from the supplier, to the manufacturer, and then to the consumer (Holma & Salo, 2010). IT has changed the dynamics of how the supply chain works (Eamonn & Kelly, 2015). As a result of the involvement of IT in the supply chain processes and the proliferation of the Internet by technological advancement, supply chain has evolved 3 
9.	
10.	from the physical exchange of information between artisans and consumers, to a virtual chain of suppliers, manufacturers and consumers, now referred to as the value web (as shown in figure 1) (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999). The value web is a virtual supply chain, that allows for the efficient exchange of information between organisations and their trading partners, irrespective of their location (Eamonn & Kelly, 2015). 
11.	Figure 1. Supply Chains evolve to Value Chain (Eamonn & Kelly, 2015) 
12.	Also, new technologies (such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) system; SharePoint; Cloud storage) are enabling the integration of all units, stakeholders and activities in the manufacturing business (as shown in figure 2) (CSIT, 1995). Thereby facilitating globalisation in the manufacturing sector (Dahlman, 2007; SAP & INFOR, 2007; Globalization101, 2012). 4

14.	Figure 2. IT as an integrator of all business activities in manufacturing organisations (CSIT, 1995) 
15.	In spite of the criticality of IT in the manufacturing sector, it is often considered to be a support tool or function and not a core function to the entire manufacturing process (Srinivasan & Jayaraman, 1999). Hence, organisations outsource their IT functions. However, outsourcing comes with some risks such as vendor lock-in, unsatisfactory service quality, loss of intellectual properties, expending extra cost, security issues etc., which could be more complex and challenging (Gonzalez, Gasco & Llopis, 2009; Demaria, 2011). Hence, the presence of inherent risks in ITO is necessitating that organisations identify, evaluate and institute possible risk treatments before engaging in ITO (Tompkins, Simonson, Upchurch & Tompkins, 2005; Deloitte, 2014b). 
16.	BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY 
17.	Today, organisations are working towards cutting operational cost in order to maximise profit. Hence, they are outsourcing part or whole of their functional unit in order to deal with organisational limitations and overall expenses (Beaumont & Sohal, 2004). IT remains the most outsourced functional unit in most organisations (Ramanujan & Jane, 2006). IT unit is usually affected when organisations intend to cut cost. This is because, IT is most often regarded as a complex and expensive support function (Carr, 2003). Some organisations outsource selected parts of their IT functions while some outsource all of their IT functions, to a third party, who in return, renders IT as a service to them (Dibbern et al., 2004; Applegate et al., 2009). 
18.	Outsourcing first came into limelight in the 19th century through a British economist known as David Ricardo, who came up with the economic principle of “comparative advantage” (Ritchie, 2015). Before the advent of the business concept “outsourcing”, organisational model consisted of large integrated companies that managed and controlled their assets internally (Ritchie, 2015). Managers of organisations observed that, the bloated strategy of managing all business 5 
19.	
20.	activities in-house was hindering their (respective) organisations from competing globally (Handfield, 2008; Ritchie, 2015). This observation caused organisations to search for a more flexible and cost effective way of managing their asset and resources (Handfield, 2008). The outcome of this search, resulted in the business concept known as “outsourcing” (Davis & Knox, 2004; Handfield, 2008). Outsourcing as explained by Gilley &Rasheed (2000), is the contracting out of an organisation’s assets and resources to a third party organisation. Over the years, outsourcing has evolved from contracting external suppliers for ancillary services to operational outsourcing (contracting external suppliers for support services) and now, to strategic outsourcing (contracting external suppliers for core business services) (Handfield, 2008). 
21.	ITO was first operationalised in the 20th century by Eastman Kodak (Loh & Venkatraman, 1992; Dibbern et al., 2004; Ritchie, 2015). In 1989, Kodak (an imaging solutions company) braced the IT outsourcing market by outsourcing all its IT functions to IBM (DiRomualdo & Gurbaxani, 1998; Dibbern et al., 2004), DEC and Businessland (Hirschheim & Lacity, 1997; Dibbern et al., 2004). This marked a significant event referred to as “the Kodak effect”, in the IT industry (Loh & Venkatraman, 1992). This is because Kodak, who regarded IT to be a strategic asset and also had the capability to manage their IT internally, was the least expected organisation to move IT outside (Applegate & Montealegre, 1991). Other large and small organisations such as J.P. Morgan, Xerox Corporation, Dupont where influenced by Kodak’s approach to outsource IT. Hence, they followed the same footstep as Kodak, by engaging in ITO contracts that were worth billions of dollars (DiRomualdo & Gurbaxani, 1998). 
22.	The outsourcing market experienced fluctuation (i.e. unstable engagement of organisations in ITO) between year the 2000 and 2015 (Statista, 2015). However, due to the recent and continuous technological advancement, industry analysts have projected that outsourcing engagements will increase exponentially in the years to come (Arshad, May-Lin & Mohamed, 2008; Deloitte, 2014a). Presently, the adoption of technological innovations such as cloud computing, big data, business intelligence etc., by organisations, are contributing to the growth observed in the ITO market (Deloitte, 2014a). The development and management of these technological innovations involves a lot of challenges and risks (Kumar, 2016), however, most organisations understand the importance of technological innovations in supporting their core business operations (Deloitte, 2014a). Hence, organisations fall back on ITO in order to gain the benefits offered by IT innovations, while at the same time transferring the challenges and risks involved in the development and management of IT innovations to a third party organisation (Deloitte, 2014a). 
23.	RESEARCH PROBLEM 
24.	Outsourcing, IT, globalization, customer satisfaction etc. have been listed as some of the business challenges faced by today’s organisations (Tompkins et al., 2005; Bernard, 2015). IT is listed as a challenge due to its complexity, while outsourcing is understood to be a more unique challenge because it is both a solution to other business challenges and a challenge on its own (Tompkins et al., 2005). Consequently, ITO is a more complex and unique business challenge (Arshad et al., 2008). Organisations are facing outsourcing challenges such as defining their outsourcing strategy, selecting the right vendor, managing their outsourcing contract etc. (Paul, 2004; Syed, Arshad & Mohamed, 2007). However, despite these challenges, 6 
25.	
26.	organisations are still engaging in outsourcing. If these challenges are taken care of, outsourcing is more of an opportunity than a challenge (Tompkins et al., 2005). 
27.	Today, outsourcing of business functions is becoming a practice in almost every organisation (Ritchie, 2015). The opportunities and benefits of ITO have been proven by different studies (Rochester & Rochester, 1995; Dhar & Balakrishnan, 2006; Tayauova, 2012; Ritchie, 2015). However, ITO comes with risks (Dhar & Balakrishnan, 2006; Arshad et al., 2008; Deloitte, 2014b). Catherine (2004), identified some of these risks, which include: vendor lock-in; loss of control over physical IT security; logical IT security risk; confidentiality; privacy concerns etc. If these risks are not well managed, the outsourcing organisation could be faced with threats such as reputational damage, value leakage, adverse effect on organisation’s operating model, financial performance and total engagement failure (Deloitte, 2014b). 
28.	In 2000, Oxford University’s Institute of Information management, and the University of Missouri (USA) conducted a study that tracked 29 outsourcing contracts for eight years. It was reported from this study that, more than 35% of the contracts failed (Catherine, 2004). This indicates that almost half of outsourcing initiatives are unsuccessful (Gregg, 2003). MacInnis (2003) indicated that one third of outsourcing deals fail in their first year, while half request for contract renegotiation with their service providers. Paul (2004) in his article “most outsourcing is still for losers” stated that all participants of the largest ITO engagement in the world ended up as losers. Also, a survey done by Deloitte Consulting LLP in 2012 on global outsourcing and insourcing, showed that 48% of outsourcing contracts were terminated due to concerns over service quality, while 24% rated their outsourcing contract as unsatisfactory (Deloitte, 2014b). 
29.	Majority of these ITO failure stories were attributed to the incompetence of the outsourcing organisations in overcoming the challenges of ITO (MacInnis, 2003; Paul, 2004). Most organisations do not have a clear picture of the function they are outsourcing, thereby making the outsourcing engagement complex and difficult to manage (Paul, 2004). Some other organisations get disappointed at the end of an outsourcing deal or half way into the engagement, due to their over expectation from outsourcing and lack of risk management (MacInnis, 2003). Manufacturing organisations in South Africa are partakers of ITO (Johnston, Abader, Brey & Stander, 2009). A typical example of such engagement is Nampak’s (a Global Manufacturing Limited) IT service outsourcing to Dimension Data (a Global Technology Organisation), which is just one amongst several other ITO contracts engaged by South Africa manufacturing organisations. The increase in the adoption of ITO by organisations is necessitating the continuous research in ITO field. Also, the constant change in business requirements and IT evolution is forcing a continuous revisit of the risks and risks management practices of ITO, so as to propose better ways of managing potential ITO risks.

40.	LITERATURE REVIEW 
41.	Outsourcing has been defined as the use of external resources to perform internal business goals (Demaria, 2011). Tayauova (2012, p. 189) also defined outsourcing to be the “delegation of operations or jobs to a third party, who can do it better, cheaper and faster”. Outsourcing is being adopted globally by small, medium and large enterprises in both the private and public sector for so many reasons (Varadarajan, 2009; Plugge, Bouwman & Molina-Castillo, 2013). Researchers have identified economic reasons such as cost cutting, conservation of resources (Statista, 2015) and reduction in overhead staff as the major motivation for outsourcing. However, Gonzalez, Gasco & Llopis (2010) findings shows that economic reasons are not the priority for outsourcing in today’s organisations. Organisations are now outsourcing with the motive of improving business efficiency, focusing on core competencies (DiRomualdo & Gurbaxani, 1998; Gonzalez et al., 2009; Johnston et al., 2009), avoiding certain costs (Statista, 2015) (such as taxes) and risks (Dibbern et al., 2004; Gonzalez et al., 2009). Outsourcing is also increasing the opportunity for organisations to tap into external resource base, add value to processes and mitigate business risks (Statista, 2015). Organisations are outsourcing different business units such as logistics, human resources (HR), customer representation etc., however Information Technology (IT)/Information Systems (IS) is one of the most outsourced business unit (Ramanujan & Jane, 2006). 
42.	According to the literature, information technology outsourcing (ITO) is “the use of a third party to successfully deliver IT enabled business processes, application services and infrastructure solutions for a cost effective business outcome” (Samantra, Datta & Mahapatra, 2014, p. 4010). Similarly, ITO is the allocation of in-house IT functions to an external service provider. (Bradley, Frederick, Jeanot, Dragon, Michael & Cesar, 2012, p. 2). ITO has been in existence and have evolved for over 20 years, which started from the moment Kodak decided to outsource all its IT functions to IBM (Samantra et al., 2014). Although, Kodak was praised to have initiated ITO, their bravery however, were soon criticised, as inexperience in ITO caused them a lot of challenges (Robert, 2011). Mitchell (2014) claimed that, over-outsourcing led to the dismissal performance of Kodak, who declared bankruptcy in 2013. 
43.	Organisations are aware of the benefits of ITO but are still conscious and careful of their outsourcing decisions (Robert, 2011). This is because ITO can be dangerous to the business if not well managed (Mitchell, 2014; Samantra et al., 2014). Business analyst’s (Deloitte, 2014a) report shows that there is a high rate of failure and dissatisfaction of ITO engagements. As a result, ITO is gaining so much interest from the academic research field. Researchers have carried out studies on different aspect of ITO which covered areas such as - effective 8 
44.	
45.	management of ITO, factors resulting to successful ITO engagement, ITO theories, models and frameworks and most recently risks and risk management of ITO (Liang, Wang, Xue & Cui, 2015). Earlier studies on ITO, such as the study of Bragg (2006), have focused more on the management of ITO initiatives such as, contract management, vendor management, ITO lifecycle, ITO strategy, types and scope of ITO. Although, studies on the management of ITO has helped to build and structure ITO practices (Lacity, Khan & Willcocks, 2009; Liang et al., 2015). Some researchers (Syed et al., 2007; Bradley et al., 2012; Samantra et al., 2014), however, noted that the study on the management of ITO is insufficient in achieving a successful ITO engagement. Studies such as that of Gonzalez et al. (2010), Lacity et al. (2009), Liang et al. (2015), Deloitte (2014a) and Samantra et al. (2014) on ITO also shows that there are potential benefits of ITO, however, risks are also involved. 
46.	According to the Institute of Risk Management (IRM, 2002), risk can be defined as the combination of the chances of an unknown event occurring and the consequences (negative or positive) of the event’s outcome. There are different perspectives to risk (IRM, 2002), but the context in which its being used matters (Aubert, Patry & Rivard, 1998). For example, in the safety field, risk is defined in relation to negative outcomes or harm to a certain event. Risk in ITO is defined with respect to negative consequences, as mentioned by Fan, Suo & Feng (2012) that, risk in ITO could lead to undesirable outcome. Also, Adeleye, Annansingh & Nunes (2004, p. 170) stated that, the purpose of risk assessment in outsourcing, is to evaluate the chances of adverse events occurring. The occurrence of undesirable outcomes in ITO are due to some factors known as risk factors (Aubert et al., 1998). 
47.	From the literature, different studies have identified risks and risk factors of ITO. Catherine (2004) for example identified 5 risk areas of ITO - logical IT security, physical IT security, human resource issues, total dependency and legal consequences. After conducting risk analysis survey (with responses from 3 organisational settings – academics, financial institution and retailer), Catherine (2004) deduced that logical IT security risks, total dependence/exist barrier and legal consequences are the top three potential risks of IT outsourcing. In a more recent study, Samantra et al. (2014) identified 11 risks of ITO – Environmental risk, strategic risk, information risk, managerial risk, time management risk, relationship risk, financial risk, legal risk, operational risk, business risk and technical risk. Samantra et al. (2014, p. 4014) also identified various risks factors, which includes – task complexity, obsolete technology skill, supplier’s deficiency in experience and expertise on the outsourced activities, loss of organisational competency, lack of contingency plan, supplier service quality etc.”. These identified risks and their respective risk factors need to be properly managed so as to establish an effective ITO engagement (Deloitte, 2014b; Samantra et al., 2014). 
48.	Deloitte (2014b) stated that organisations need to carry out risks analysis at the initial stage of planning an ITO initiative, in order to identify potential risks and mitigation techniques. This need is necessitating the establishment of risk management practices in order to ensure the successful outcome and sustenance of the ITO initiative (Osei-Bryson & Ngwenyama, 2006; Syed et al., 2007; Prado, 2011; Bradley et al., 2012; Thanapol, Settapong & Navneet, 2013). Prado (2011) also noted that the level and severity at which organisations conduct risk analysis differs and depends on the organisation’s size and type of industry. He further highlighted that manufacturing organisations give less relevance to risks analysis when outsourcing IT. This thus impact on their risk management practices. Philip &Scott (n.d) identified ITO risks 9 
49.	
50.	management practices as a factor of successful ITO engagement. Studies and reports (Alexandrova, 2012; Bradley et al., 2012; Thanapol et al., 2013; de Sá-Soares, Soares & Arnaud, 2014; Deloitte, 2014b; Samantra et al., 2014; Yildiz & Demirel, 2014) are now focusing on risks and risk management practices of ITO. However, constant change in business requirements, customer needs, organisation innovation and short technology cycle remains important risk factors in today’s ITO engagements and business environments (Prado, 2011). 
51.	THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
52.	This study will adapt two risk management frameworks in order to achieve its objectives. A conceptual framework of risk management in ITO developed by Aris et al. (2008) will be adapted to identify the risks in ITO, and a risk management framework developed by Aubert et al. (1999) will be adapted to: assess the impact of ITO risk; and investigate the risk treatments of ITO used by manufacturing organisations. Adapting these two frameworks, this study will be investigating the risk management of ITO under 3 constructs, which are 
1.	Risk Identification 
2.	Risk Assessment 
3.	Risk treatment 
53.	
54.	1st Construct – Risk Identification – In every risk management framework, risk identification is usually the first step to consider (Aris et al., 2008). The process of risks Identification helps to reveal the what, when and how questions about threats and vulnerabilities associated with an event (Gary, Alice & Alexis, 2002). Using this construct in this study, the researcher will investigate the risks associated with ITO. The risks will be investigated across the activities of the ITO lifecycle (Figure 3), which includes the - Analysis of decision to outsource; Selection of service provider; Contract management; On-going monitoring, phases as used by Aris et al. (2008). 
55.	Figure 3. A Conceptual Framework of Risk Management in IT Outsourcing (Aris et al., 2008) 
56.	2nd Construct – Risk Assessment – Risk assessment is the process of analysing and evaluating potential or anticipated risks (Aubert et al., 1999). This process helps to understand the probability of occurrence and the impact of risks. This construct will allow the researcher to analysis the probability of occurrence and the impact of ITO risks. These analysis will then be 10

62.	3rd Construct – Risk Treatment – This involves the mitigation of risks, by reducing the impact of risks or the probability of risks occurring (Aubert et al., 1999; Gary et al., 2002). This process is used to bring risks to an acceptable level. Using this construct in this study, the researcher will investigate mitigation techniques or control measures established by manufacturing organisations in bringing the risk of ITO to an acceptable level. 
63.	SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY 
64.	Many studies have investigated the practice and management of ITO (Gonzalez, Gasco & Llopis, 2006; Ritchie, 2015; Vaxevanou & Konstantopoulos, 2015; Kumar, 2016). However, only few amongst them have focused on the risk management practices of ITO (Catherine, 2004; Syed et al., 2007; Aris et al., 2008; Arshad et al., 2008; Demaria, 2011; Bradley et al., 2012). Also limited study was found to have investigated the risk management practices of ITO in manufacturing organisations. This study intends to fill the research gap on risk management of ITO in the manufacturing field. Hence, identifying the benefits, risks and effective ways of managing risks associated with ITO. Also, findings from this study will serve as risk management resource for manufacturing organisations willing to engage or already engaging in ITO. As it will provide insight on prospective risks and ways of managing risks associated with ITO. 
65.	JUSTIFICATION 
66.	In spite of the high rate of unsuccessful ITO engagements recorded by outsourcing analysts (Statista, 2015), organisations keep engaging in ITO (MacInnis, 2003; Catherine, 2004; Paul, 2004; Deloitte, 2014a). This continuous interest shown by organisations in ITO, has necessitated the need to investigate the risk management practices established by organisations, in order to scrutinise, evaluate and recommend better means of identifying and managing ITO risks. 11 
67.	
68.	Secondly, the rapid growth and evolution of IT is resulting in the emergences of new technologies such as cloud computing (Muhic & Johansson, 2014). These technologies are now informing new ways of IT service delivery (Muhic & Johansson, 2014). As a result of this, new sourcing varietals, challenges, and risks of ITO is evolving. Hence, necessitating the research on risks, that organisations are facing with their ITO engagements. 
69.	RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
70.	Research methodology is a systematic approach towards solving a specific research problem (Rajasekar, Philominathan & Chinnathambi, 2013). It comprises of the science of examining how research is being conducted. It involves the procedures, step by step approach and techniques a researcher has decided to use in investigating the research problem or achieving the research objectives. 
71.	Research design 
72.	Research design helps to guide the data collection process of a study (Bhattacherjee, 2012). It is the blueprint that entails the procedures and techniques that will be used by a researcher to go about acquiring and analyzing applicable data that will be used to answer specific research questions. Research design encompasses the sampling method, data collection process and the research instrument development process. The research design that will be used in this study is the exploratory research design. 
73.	The exploratory research design 
74.	Exploratory Research design allows the researcher to carry out a clear and systematic search for new insights on the phenomena under study, as well as assessing the phenomena in a clearer perspective (Robson, 2002). This research design also gives room for further understanding of a problem, thereby providing the researcher a clearer picture of the research problem being investigated (Saunders, Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill, 2011). The adoption of the exploratory research design to this study will provide a deeper and clearer understanding of the risks and risks management practices of ITO in manufacturing organisations within South Africa. 
75.	Research approach 
76.	According to Rajasekar et al. (2013), research method refers to the schemes, algorithms and systematic procedures used by researchers in order to attain the objectives of their research. The two types of research methods are the quantitative methods and qualitative methods (Saunders et al., 2011). Quantitative method is used when the research findings and results will be measured in quantity or amounts, while qualitative method is used when the research objective is focused on answering problems of how and why, about the phenomena being studied (Rajasekar et al., 2013). The results and findings generated when using qualitative research method is not usually generalizable to a larger population (Patton, 1990). 
77.	The qualitative method will be employed in this study because it will give the researcher an avenue to carry out an in-depth investigation of the risks associated with ITO in manufacturing organisations within South Africa, and it will also enable the researcher to explore and analyse measures that are put in place to manage these risks. 12 
78.	
79.	Study site 
80.	The physical location or place where data will be collected is referred to as the study site. The study site for this study will be a manufacturing organisation (within South Africa) that has agreed to participate in the study. The organisation will be used as a case study. 
81.	Population of the Study 
82.	Population of the study could be referred to as the total number of units, people or individual present in a geographical location or in the study site where data collection will be carried out (Lavrakas, 2008). Considering the total number of units in a study site, data collection will be focused on a subset of the population of study known as the target population. According to Burns &Grove (1997), target population is the total number of units, people or individual present in a certain area or location that are of great interest to the research due to certain attribute or expertise they possess. For this study, the target population will be the managerial staff of the organisations under investigation, who are responsible for the decision making and management of ITO. The characteristics of a population is known as the criteria that defines who is eligible or not eligible to participate in a study (Stommel & Wills, 2004). Therefore, for this study, some of the responsibilities or characteristics of the target staff would include: decision making analyst, contract management, risk management, vendor relationship management etc. This means that the respondents of this study are expected to have knowledge about the principles of outsourcing and at the same time understand the risk management techniques used in outsourcing. 
83.	Sampling methods 
84.	Due to the adoption of qualitative research methodology for this study, the non-probability sampling method will be used to select the participants for the study. The non-probability sampling method is a subjective type of sampling method which allows the researcher to select the participants of the study based on a non-random criteria (Bhattacherjee, 2012). Hence, some of the units in the population will have a zero chance of being selected (Saunders et al., 2011). The expert sampling technique will be used to choose the samples from the population of this study. 
85.	The expert sampling technique is a sampling technique in which participants of a study are selected on a non-random based criteria, hence samples are chosen based on their expertise on the phenomena being investigated (Bhattacherjee, 2012). In this study, interviews will be conducted for ten staff from each of the two organisations where data will be collected. The interview participants will include executive management staff and other management staff of the organisations, whose responsibilities includes the management of ITO in their respective organisations. 
86.	The sample size and sample 
87.	A sample is a subset of a population whose characteristics when studied, is duly representative of the entire target population Cherry (2015). According to Yin (2003), the sample size of a study is the total number of observations or respondents that have been selected to participate in the study. The rules for selecting the number of respondents to partake in a study depends on the research methodology. According to Patton (1990), there are no specified rules for measuring the sample size in a qualitative research. He further explains that; qualitative sample 13 
88.	
89.	size depends on the dimension (depth or breadth) the researcher seeks to inquiry. Considering the research method (qualitative methodology) for this study, 15 respondents will be interviewed. They will comprise of Executive managers (5) such as Chief Information Officer and IT Risk and Governance manager; and other management staff (10) such as Project managers who have a stake in the decision making on ITO in the organization. 
90.	Data collection methods 
91.	According to Saunders et al. (2011), there are different methods of collecting data when conducting a research. However, the choice of data collection method depends on the research methodology used in a study (Bhattacherjee, 2012). Interviews are used for qualitative studies, while surveys are suitable for quantitative studies (Saunders et al., 2011). Since this study will be adopting the qualitative approach, interviews will be used as the mode for data collection. According to Saunders et al. (2011), interview is a purposeful discussion between two or more people in order to achieve a certain objective. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted for the respondents of this study. The semi-structured interview technique will be adopted over structured and unstructured interview techniques. This is because semi structured interviews are more flexible than structured interviews, and also systematic when compared to unstructured interviews. 
92.	Data quality control 
93.	In order to ensure that the data that will be collected and analysed are reliable and valid, data quality control techniques will be applied (Saunders et al., 2011). According to DataONE (2012), error of commission and error of omission are two types of errors that could contaminate the dataset that have been collected and analysed during the process of data collection and analysis of a research. Error of commission occurs as a result of the respondent giving inappropriate information about the research phenomena, while error of omission occurs due to omission or inadequate documentation during data collection process (DataONE, 2012). 
94.	In this study, error of commission will be addressed by conducting a pilot study. A pilot study is the prior administration of the research instrument to a smaller number of the entire size intended for the study (Saunders et al., 2011). Conducting a Pilot study, will enable the researcher to assess the clarity of the content in the research instrument (Saunders et al., 2011). Then the result of the pilot study will be used to refine the content of the research instrument that will then be administered to the entire sample population. According to Bhattacherjee (2012), conducting a pilot study helps to validate the research instrument (Bhattacherjee, 2012). Hence, assuring the credibility of the research findings and results (Bhattacherjee, 2012). Error of omission on the other hand, will be addressed by recording the interviews using an audio recorder. The researcher will request the permission of the respondents to record the interview sessions, in order to avoid omissions or misinterpretation of the respondents’ responses during coding and analysis of the collected data. 
95.	Data Analysis 
96.	Data collected during the course of this study will be analysed using the thematic technique of data analysis. The thematic technique of data analysis is a qualitative analytic/analysis method used by researchers to gain insight and generate knowledge from the data collected when a qualitative research method is used (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Using the thematic data analysis 14 
97.	
98.	technique in this study, the collected data from the interviews will be analysed and reported in sections of identified patterns known as themes. 
99.	ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
100.	According to Resnik (2011), ethics could be defined as the procedures or methods that defines good and bad practices. Ethics in research helps to guide and monitor the researcher’s mode of practices while undergoing a study. It also ensures that the researcher’s objective is not basically focused on collecting data from its respondents but must at the same time consider the respondent’s safety and dignity (Gregory, 2003). Ethical considerations that will be preserved during the cause of this study includes: confidentiality, anonymity and privacy of the respondents. 
101.	In order to assure the respondents that all ethical considerations will be preserved, an informed consent, which will serve as a written agreement between the respondent and researcher will be given to respondents to sign. This will also be a prove to show that respondents were informed of the motive and objectives of the research before data was collected and that respondents agreed willingly to participate in the study. In order to uphold the ethics of confidentiality and privacy, respondents would be informed that they have the right to conceal information they do not feel comfortable to disclose. And then anonymity will be maintained by withholding any form of respondent’s identity such as name, address, job designation and company while presenting the findings and results of this study, except with the permission of the respondents 
102.	LIMITATIONS TO THE STUDY 
103.	A limitation of ease to access and availability of respondent will be encountered during the data collection exercise of this study. This will be due to the position and level the respondents hold (as key decision makers) in the organisation. This limitation will be managed by establishing good rapport with the secretary or personal assistant of respondents. Also, interview schedules will be planned to suit the respondent’s most suitable time and reminder will be sent to them to confirm their availability on the expected day for the interview. Another limitation that will be encountered during the course of this study is the limited literatures on the risks and risk management practices of ITO in the manufacturing sector. In order to deal with this limitation, literatures on risks and risk management practices of ITO in other sectors such as education and banking will be considered in this study.
