Your response: As the CEO, I need a comprehensive strategic plan for launching a new product line. This plan should include: Market Analysis (target demographics, competitive landscape, market size); Financial Projections (3-year revenue forecast, cost analysis, profitability); Operational Requirements (resources, production timelines, supply chain); HR Impact (staffing, training, organizational changes); Sales Strategy (go-to-market, pricing, distribution). Ensure recommendations are supported by internal policy documents and external market research. Provide a consolidated summary of key findings and actionable recommendations.

My Response: Alright I am done running our most recent request. Please read and analyze temp.txt for results and entire terminal input and output so far. So here are my concerns: Does it align with our NEVER_CHANGING_PRIVATE_PROMPT or should it or any other files revolving around it be updated? What about NEVER_CHANGING_VISION.md or any other files within C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic\Project_Tracker, including all files and folders. Where will Logs folder and files be created since it is part of our main project? C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic\Logs?
