## 2. FIREWALL INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW

### Firewall Devices

#### Primary Firewall
- **Hostname:** [FW-01 or device name]
- **Model:** [Manufacturer and model]
- **Firmware Version:** [Current version]
- **Management IP:** [IP address]
- **Role:** [Primary/Active firewall]
- **Interfaces:**
  - External (WAN): [IP address/subnet]
  - Internal (LAN): [IP address/subnet]
  - DMZ: [IP address/subnet if applicable]
  - Management: [IP address/subnet]

#### Secondary Firewall (if applicable)

### Security Zones

**Zone Definitions:**

| Zone Name | Security Level | Networks | Purpose | Default Action |
|-----------|----------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| External | Untrusted (0) | Internet | External networks | DENY ALL |
| DMZ | Low Trust (25) | 192.168.100.0/24 | Public-facing servers | DENY to Internal |
| Internal | Trusted (100) | 10.0.0.0/8 | Corporate network | ALLOW (filtered) |
| Management | High Trust (100) | 10.0.0.0/24 | Network devices | RESTRICT Access |
| Guest | Untrusted (10) | 10.4.0.0/24 | Guest WiFi | Internet ONLY |
| VPN | Medium Trust (75) | 10.5.0.0/24 | Remote users | ALLOW (filtered) |

**Zone Trust Relationships:**
```
External (0) → DMZ (25) [Specific services only]
External (0) → Internal (100) [DENY ALL]
DMZ (25) → Internal (100) [DENY except specific]
Internal (100) → DMZ (25) [ALLOW management]
Internal (100) → External (0) [ALLOW with NAT]
Guest (10) → External (0) [ALLOW internet only]
Guest (10) → Internal (100) [DENY ALL]
VPN (75) → Internal (100) [ALLOW based on user]
```

## 3. FIREWALL RULE STRUCTURE

### Rule Naming Convention

**Standard Format:**
```
[RuleNumber]-[Direction]-[Source]-[Destination]-[Service]-[Action]

Examples:
- 100-IN-EXT-DMZ-WEB-ALLOW
- 200-OUT-INT-ANY-HTTP-ALLOW
- 300-IN-DMZ-INT-ANY-DENY
```

### Rule Fields Explanation

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Rule #** | Unique rule number (processed in order) | 100 |
| **Name** | Descriptive rule name | Allow Web Traffic to DMZ |
| **Source Zone** | Origin security zone | External |
| **Source Address** | Source IP/network/group | Any |
| **Destination Zone** | Destination security zone | DMZ |
| **Destination Address** | Destination IP/network | 192.168.100.10 |
| **Service** | Protocol and port | HTTP (TCP/80) |
| **Action** | ALLOW or DENY | ALLOW |
| **Logging** | Enable/Disable logging | ENABLED |
| **Schedule** | When rule is active | Always |
| **Comment** | Why rule exists | Public website access |

### Rule Processing Order

**Important:** Firewall rules are processed **in order from top to bottom**. First match wins!

```
Rule 1: ALLOW specific traffic → Match? Yes → ALLOW (stop processing)
Rule 2: DENY broader traffic → Not evaluated if Rule 1 matched
Rule 3: ALLOW everything → Catch-all (usually DENY ALL)
```

**Best Practice:**
1. Specific ALLOW rules at top
2. Specific DENY rules in middle
3. Implicit DENY ALL at bottom (default)

## 15. TROUBLESHOOTING BLOCKED TRAFFIC

### How to Investigate Blocked Connections

**Step 1: Gather Information**
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Destination port/protocol
- Time of occurrence
- Error message user received

**Step 2: Check Firewall Logs**
- Search logs for source IP
- Identify which rule blocked traffic
- Verify if block was intentional

**Step 3: Determine if Traffic Should Be Allowed**
- Is this legitimate business traffic?
- Is there a business justification?
- What is the security risk?
- Is there an existing rule that should match?

**Step 4: Resolution**

**If traffic should be allowed:**
1. Submit change request
2. Get approval
3. Create rule
4. Test
5. Document

**If traffic should remain blocked:**
1. Explain to user why it's blocked
2. Suggest alternative solution if possible
3. Escalate to IT Manager if user disputes

### Common Blocked Traffic Scenarios

**Scenario 1: User Cannot Access Website**
- Check if website category is blocked
- Check if website has malware/reputation issue
- Verify not DNS resolution problem
- Check if legitimate business need

**Scenario 2: Application Not Working**
- Identify what ports application needs
- Check if those ports are blocked
- Verify application server is in correct VLAN
- Check if existing rule should have matched

**Scenario 3: Remote User Cannot Access Resource**
- Verify VPN connected successfully
- Check VPN user group permissions
- Verify route to resource exists
- Check if resource allows VPN network
