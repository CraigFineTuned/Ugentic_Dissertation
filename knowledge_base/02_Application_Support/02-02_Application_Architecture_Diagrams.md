## 12. TROUBLESHOOTING USING ARCHITECTURE

### How to Use This Document for Troubleshooting

**Symptom: Application is slow**
1. Check the data flow diagram to identify potential bottlenecks
2. Check each component in the path: User → Load Balancer → Web Server → App Server → Database
3. Use architecture to identify which team to collaborate with:
   - Network issues → Network team
   - Server performance → Infrastructure team
   - Application logic → Vendor or development team

**Symptom: Integration failing**
1. Reference the integration architecture section
2. Identify the specific integration point
3. Check authentication, connectivity, and data format
4. Follow the integration failure procedures

**Symptom: Users cannot authenticate**
1. Check the authentication flow diagram
2. Identify the authentication service (AD, SSO, etc.)
3. Verify connectivity to authentication service
4. Check service accounts and permissions

## NOTES FOR USING THIS DOCUMENT

**For the AI Agent:**
- Use this document to understand system architecture when troubleshooting
- Reference integration diagrams when investigating data flow issues
- Check dependency matrix to understand impact of component failures
- Use this to identify which teams to collaborate with based on the component

**For Maintenance:**
- Update diagrams immediately after any architecture changes
- Review quarterly to ensure accuracy
- Use a consistent diagramming standard
- Version control your diagrams
- Include dates on all diagrams

**For Populating This Template:**
- Start with your most critical application
- You can create diagrams in any tool and reference them here
- Don't need perfect diagrams initially - even a text-based diagram helps
- Add detail incrementally as you document the environment
- Include IP addresses, hostnames, and ports for troubleshooting
- Ask Infrastructure and Network teams for their documentation to reference

**Diagram Tips:**
- Can use text-based diagrams initially (ASCII art works!)
- Can link to image files stored elsewhere
- Can embed markdown mermaid diagrams for simple flows
- Focus on clarity over beauty - troubleshooting is the goal

---

**Template Status:** Ready for population  
**Priority:** Start with your most critical or complex application  
**Estimated Time to Complete:** 2-4 hours per application for basic documentation  
**Next Steps:** Choose first application and create high-level architecture diagram
