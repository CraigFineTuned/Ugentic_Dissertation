  "root_cause": "The root cause of the sporadic internet disconnections is likely related to DNS server instability or misconfiguration across multiple remote offices, exacerbated by a potential firewall configuration issue on VPN clients. The intermittent nature of the problem suggests that it occurs at regular intervals, possibly due to periodic DNS cache refreshes or maintenance windows affecting external DNS servers.",
  "solution": "Implement a unified DNS solution across all remote offices, ensuring high availability and redundancy. This could involve setting up a local DNS server in each office with failover capabilities to an external primary DNS server. Additionally, review and standardize VPN client configurations to ensure compatibility and stability. Conduct regular monitoring of DNS server health and implement alerts for any anomalies or performance issues.",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collective approach enabled a comprehensive understanding of the issue by leveraging diverse expertise across infrastructure, network support, IT support, and service desk functions. By pooling knowledge and resources, we were able to identify the root cause more effectively and implement a sustainable solution that addressed both DNS server stability and VPN client configuration challenges.",
