# Ubuntu Orchestration Event

**Collaboration ID:** ubuntu_collab_20251014_185642
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-14T19:00:19.896189

## Participating Agents

- Infrastructure
- App Support

## Root Cause

The root cause is a combination of inefficient file storage and usage, coupled with insufficient disk space allocation in the multi-domain environment.

## Solution

To address this issue comprehensively, the following steps will be taken: 1) Analyze current storage utilization across all domains to identify redundant files and optimize storage configurations. 2) Implement automated scripts to regularly clean up temporary and unnecessary files. 3) Increase disk space where necessary by adding more storage capacity or optimizing existing resources. 4) Establish policies for regular maintenance and monitoring of disk usage.

## Ubuntu Value

The Ubuntu collaboration allowed for a more holistic approach by combining knowledge from both infrastructure and application support teams. This led to a more effective solution that considered the entire system rather than just isolated parts.
