# Ubuntu Orchestration Event

**Collaboration ID:** ubuntu_collab_20251015_113420

## Participating Agents

- Infrastructure
- IT Support

## Root Cause

The user's lack of permissions in the 'user_support' domain and a multi-domain configuration issue led to the inability to reset their own password.

## Solution

To address this, a cross-domain administrative account with appropriate permissions should be created. This account would allow for seamless password resets across all domains involved. Additionally, a process will be established to ensure that users are directed to the correct domain for password resets based on their account type and location within the multi-domain structure.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach allowed for a more comprehensive solution by integrating knowledge from both domains (infrastructure and support) rather than addressing only one aspect. This resulted in a more robust and lasting fix.
