  "root_cause": "The root cause is a multi-domain issue: a technical problem with the printer's queue (two stuck print jobs blocking new jobs) combined with a network/domain configuration issue that prevented the queue from being managed remotely and may have contributed to the initial job corruption.",
  "solution": "A multi-step solution: 1) Clear the printer's queue by power-cycling the printer to purge the stuck jobs. 2) Verify that Sarah can now print a test document. 3) Investigate and resolve the underlying network domain issue that prevented IT Support from managing the queue remotely, ensuring proper cross-domain communication for future administrative tasks.",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collective approach ensured the problem was viewed holistically. Instead of just clearing the queue (IT's finding) or just fixing the network (Network's finding), the solution addressed the interconnection of both issues, leading to a more robust and permanent fix.",
