  "root_cause": "The root cause was a complex DNS resolution conflict occurring across multiple domains that only became apparent when intermittent VPN connections synchronized with DNS cache refresh cycles (every 2-3 hours). The issue manifested as brief connectivity drops when VPN clients attempted to resolve domain names across different authentication domains simultaneously, causing temporary routing conflicts that resolved once DNS caches cleared.",
  "solution": "Implement a unified DNS resolution strategy for VPN connections that includes: 1) Configuring VPN clients to use domain-specific DNS suffixes rather than attempting cross-domain resolution simultaneously, 2) Adjusting DNS cache refresh intervals to prevent synchronization with VPN keep-alive cycles, 3) Implementing DNS forwarding rules on the VPN concentrator to handle multi-domain queries more efficiently, and 4) Adding monitoring for DNS resolution patterns during VPN sessions to detect similar conflicts proactively.",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collective approach allowed each team to contribute their specialized knowledge - infrastructure understood the timing patterns, network understood the DNS mechanics, and IT support understood the user impact. Without collaboration, each team would have pursued separate solutions (DNS changes, firewall adjustments, user reconfigurations) that would have only partially addressed the issue.",
