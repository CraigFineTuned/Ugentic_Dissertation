## Root Cause

A multi-domain authentication issue caused by a corrupted user profile record where the email address field was truncated during storage, creating an invalid authentication token that the expense application could not process, leading to permission errors and crashes on startup.

## Solution

1. Repair the corrupted user profile record for 'finance_department_representative_user' by correcting the truncated email address field. 2. Implement database validation rules to prevent field truncation during profile creation. 3. Update the authentication system to handle multi-domain scenarios more gracefully. 4. Add proper error handling in the expense application to catch authentication failures without crashing. 5. Conduct a comprehensive audit of all user profiles for similar truncation issues.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach allowed connecting infrastructure-level multi-domain issues with application-level domain requirements and specific user profile corruption, revealing that no single perspective alone would have identified the complete chain of failure from database corruption to application crash.
