# Ubuntu Orchestration Event

**Collaboration ID:** ubuntu_collab_20251015_095325
**Timestamp:** 2025-10-15T09:56:07.925486

## Participating Agents

- Infrastructure
- IT Support

## Root Cause

The 'ask_questions' tool's non-registration in the user_support system is preventing a deeper diagnostic, while the multi-domain issue indicates that the low disk space problem might be compounded by data inconsistencies or misconfigurations across multiple domains.

## Solution

Register the 'ask_questions' tool in the user_support system to enable diagnostic questions and gain more insight. Simultaneously, perform a thorough domain-wide analysis of disk usage patterns and configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations that may be contributing to low disk space issues.

## Ubuntu Value

The Ubuntu collaboration facilitated a comprehensive approach where both technical investigation (Infrastructure Lead) and system functionality (IT Support) were considered, leading to a more holistic solution. The collective effort ensured no single aspect was overlooked.
