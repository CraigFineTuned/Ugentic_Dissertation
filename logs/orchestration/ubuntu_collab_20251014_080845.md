## Participating Agents

- Infrastructure
- Network Support

## Root Cause

The root cause is a misconfiguration in the domain settings, leading to access issues for shared drives within Ubuntu collaboration.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, we need to correct the domain configuration settings. Specifically, we should ensure that all domain controllers are properly synchronized and that the network policies allow for secure communication between all nodes. Additionally, enabling SMB (Server Message Block) protocol on both ends will facilitate seamless access to shared drives.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach allowed for a more comprehensive understanding of the issue, combining infrastructure knowledge with network expertise to pinpoint the exact cause. This collaboration ensured a faster resolution by addressing both the domain configuration and network policies simultaneously.
