## Participating Agents

- Infrastructure
- Network Support

## Root Cause

The root cause of Sarah Chen's inability to print from Building B is a misconfigured network printer driver on her Ubuntu workstation, which prevented proper communication with the networked printer despite successful connection attempts.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, update and properly configure the printer drivers on Sarah's Ubuntu system. This includes ensuring the correct driver version is installed for the specific printer model being used in Building B. Additionally, verify firewall settings allow necessary print traffic between the workstation and the networked printer.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach allowed for a comprehensive investigation, considering both infrastructure and technical aspects. This ensured that all potential causes were explored, leading to a more effective resolution.
