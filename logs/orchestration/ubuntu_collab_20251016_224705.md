## Root Cause

A multi-domain DNS resolution issue caused by a misconfigured split-tunnel VPN. The VPN client's DNS settings were overriding local DNS configurations, causing intermittent failures when attempting to resolve certain domains that were not properly routed through the corporate firewall.

## Solution

Reconfigure the VPN client's DNS settings to use the corporate DNS servers exclusively for work-related domains while allowing local DNS resolution for other traffic. Update the corporate firewall rules to ensure all necessary domains for the VPN are whitelisted and properly routed. Finally, push a standardized VPN configuration profile to all remote office users to prevent recurrence.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach prevented a siloed blame game (e.g., 'It's the firewall' vs. 'It's the users' configs'). By sharing findings, the team quickly correlated the Infrastructure Lead's multi-domain discovery with IT Support's VPN hypothesis and Network Support's domain-specific data, leading to a unified and accurate diagnosis.
