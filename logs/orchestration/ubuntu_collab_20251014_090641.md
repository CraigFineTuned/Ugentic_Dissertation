## Root Cause

The multi-domain issue caused incorrect domain resolution, leading to inaccessible shared drive on the server.

To resolve this, update DNS settings and ensure correct domain name resolution. Additionally, implement network policies and configurations that restrict access only to authorized domains and users, enhancing security while ensuring accessibility.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis from both infrastructure and network perspectives, leading to an integrated solution that addresses security and accessibility. This collaboration ensures no single aspect is overlooked in resolving complex issues.
