  "root_cause": "A firewall rule exists on the network infrastructure that explicitly denies incoming connections to the printer's IP address or port (likely 3389) from external sources, preventing users like John Smith in Building A from accessing the printer.",
  "solution": "Modify the firewall rule to allow incoming connections on port 3389 (or the printer's actual port) from the IP address range associated with Building A's network.  This should be done with careful consideration of security implications, potentially limiting access to only authorized users or devices within Building A.  Document the change for auditing purposes.",
