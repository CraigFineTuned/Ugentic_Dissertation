  "root_cause": "The root cause of Sarah Chen's inability to print from Building B is a misconfigured network printer driver on her Ubuntu workstation, which prevented proper communication with the networked printer despite successful connection attempts.",
  "solution": "To resolve this issue, update and properly configure the printer drivers on Sarah's Ubuntu system. This includes ensuring the correct driver version is installed for the specific printer model being used in Building B. Additionally, verify firewall settings allow necessary print traffic between the workstation and the networked printer.",
