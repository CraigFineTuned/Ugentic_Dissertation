  "root_cause": "A multi-domain issue within the VPN infrastructure is preventing remote users from establishing connections. This issue likely stems from a configuration inconsistency or a problem with the routing/address resolution across multiple domains within the VPN setup. The problem was identified through investigation by Infrastructure, Network Support, and IT Support teams, indicating a complex, multi-faceted problem.",
  "solution": "Implement a comprehensive solution involving a thorough review and harmonization of VPN configuration across all domains. This includes: 1) Validating and correcting VPN server and client configurations for consistency. 2) Investigating and resolving routing issues between domains, potentially involving adjustments to routing tables or network policies. 3) Ensuring proper DNS resolution across all domains to prevent name resolution failures. 4) Implementing robust monitoring and alerting to proactively detect and address future VPN connectivity problems. 5) Thorough testing of the solution across all affected remote user groups.",
