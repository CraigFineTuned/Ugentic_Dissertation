## Root Cause

Insufficient allocation of storage space across multiple domains, leading to a cumulative low disk space issue.

## Solution

A comprehensive strategy involving efficient storage management and reallocation, including the use of cloud-based storage solutions for offloading non-critical data. This solution also includes implementing automated monitoring systems to proactively manage and alert on disk usage.

## Ubuntu Value

The Ubuntu collaboration allowed for a holistic view of the systemâ€™s storage usage across different domains. By combining perspectives from both the Infrastructure and App Support teams, a more effective solution was devised that addressed the root cause by not only resolving immediate issues but also setting up long-term monitoring and management practices.
