  "root_cause": "A misconfigured firewall rule was causing intermittent DNS resolution failures for multiple domains, which was exacerbated by certain VPN client configurations that were overly sensitive to DNS timeouts. The network team's initial multi-domain focus and IT Support's VPN config suspicion together revealed a compound issue.",
  "solution": "1. Review and correct the specific firewall rule causing DNS query drops. 2. Adjust VPN client configurations to be more resilient to temporary DNS unavailability (e.g., implementing shorter timeouts with failover). 3. Implement monitoring for DNS query success rates across the affected offices to confirm resolution.",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collective approach prevented a siloed solution. Without collaboration, Network might have only tweaked the firewall, and IT might have only adjusted VPN settings, leaving the underlying compound issue partially unresolved. Together, they addressed both the infrastructure trigger and the user-facing symptom.",
