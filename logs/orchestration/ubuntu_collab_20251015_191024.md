## Root Cause

The inability of multiple users across different departments to access shared network files is primarily caused by firewall rules blocking necessary network ports (3389, 445, and 1433) from external sources, likely impacting the affected users' IP addresses or IP ranges. This blockage prevents the required network communication for file access, regardless of the underlying infrastructure or application.

## Solution

Implement a revised firewall rule that explicitly allows inbound traffic on ports 3389 (for Remote Desktop Protocol), 445 (for SMB/CIFS file sharing), and 1433 (for SQL Server, if applicable to the shared files).  This rule should be configured to allow traffic from the IP address ranges of the affected users' networks.  Additionally, investigate and address any other firewall rules that might be indirectly blocking access.  Document the changes to the firewall rule for future reference and auditing.  Consider implementing network segmentation to further enhance security and limit the impact of potential future issues.
