  "root_cause": "The root cause was a misconfiguration in the DNS settings of one of the domains, leading to an incorrect resolution for the shared drive's IP address.",
  "solution": "To resolve this issue, we updated the DNS records on both domains to ensure correct resolution. Additionally, we configured network policies and firewalls to allow secure access between the domains while maintaining security standards. This was followed by thorough testing of the connection from each domain to confirm that all parties could access the shared drive without issues.",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collaborative approach allowed for a comprehensive analysis from both infrastructure and network perspectives. This ensured that all aspects of the problem were addressed, leading to a more robust and secure solution.",
