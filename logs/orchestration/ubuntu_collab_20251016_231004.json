  "root_cause": "The root cause was a multi-domain DNS resolution failure affecting VPN connectivity. The issue occurred when remote users' VPN clients attempted to authenticate against multiple corporate domains simultaneously, but DNS queries for secondary domains were timing out due to misconfigured DNS forwarders at the firewall level. This caused the entire VPN session to drop temporarily until primary domain authentication could be re-established.",
  "solution": "1. Fix DNS forwarder configuration on the corporate firewall to properly handle multi-domain queries 2. Adjust VPN client configurations to prioritize primary domain authentication and implement fallback timing 3. Implement DNS caching on VPN concentrators to reduce external DNS queries 4. Add monitoring for multi-domain authentication patterns to detect similar issues proactively",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collective approach allowed each team to contribute their specialized knowledge - infrastructure saw the pattern, network found the technical misconfiguration, and IT provided the user experience context. No single team had the complete picture, but together they connected infrastructure patterns with network configuration and user experience.",
