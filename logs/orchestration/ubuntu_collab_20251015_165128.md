## Root Cause

The inability of multiple users across different departments to access shared network files is primarily caused by a firewall rule explicitly blocking inbound SMB traffic (port 3389) from external sources. This blockage prevents the necessary communication for file sharing, impacting users regardless of their department or location.

## Solution

Implement a firewall rule to allow inbound SMB traffic (ports 139 and 445) from the necessary IP address ranges or networks.  This should be done with careful consideration of security best practices, including limiting the source IP ranges to only those that require access.  Additionally, investigate and address any other potential network-level security policies that might be interfering with SMB communication.  Document the firewall change and monitor for any unexpected consequences.
