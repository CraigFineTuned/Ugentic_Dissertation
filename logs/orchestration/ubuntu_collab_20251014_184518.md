## Root Cause

The root cause is an unexpected surge in log file generation across multiple domains, leading to excessive disk usage.

## Solution

A comprehensive strategy was implemented: first, optimizing the log rotation settings; second, monitoring and limiting unnecessary background processes; third, enhancing storage management practices; and finally, educating the team on best practices for disk space management.

## Ubuntu Value

The Ubuntu collaboration improved the solution by ensuring a holistic approach that considered both immediate and long-term storage management needs. The collective insights allowed for a more robust and sustainable resolution.
