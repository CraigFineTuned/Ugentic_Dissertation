## Root Cause

The root cause was identified as a combination of insufficient initial disk space allocation and the accumulation of temporary files, logs, and unused system updates over time, affecting multiple domains within the infrastructure.

## Solution

A comprehensive solution was devised that involved reallocating more disk space to critical partitions, implementing automated cleanup scripts for temporary files and logs, setting up automatic removal of old kernel versions, and creating a monitoring system to alert administrators when disk space is critically low.

## Ubuntu Value

The Ubuntu collaboration improved the solution by bringing together different perspectives and expertise to address the root cause from multiple angles. This led to a more robust and comprehensive solution that considered all affected domains.
