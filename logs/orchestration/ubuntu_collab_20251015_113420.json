  "root_cause": "The user's lack of permissions in the 'user_support' domain and a multi-domain configuration issue led to the inability to reset their own password.",
  "solution": "To address this, a cross-domain administrative account with appropriate permissions should be created. This account would allow for seamless password resets across all domains involved. Additionally, a process will be established to ensure that users are directed to the correct domain for password resets based on their account type and location within the multi-domain structure.",
  "ubuntu_value": "The collective approach allowed for a more comprehensive solution by integrating knowledge from both domains (infrastructure and support) rather than addressing only one aspect. This resulted in a more robust and lasting fix.",
