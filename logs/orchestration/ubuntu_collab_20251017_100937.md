## Root Cause

A multi-domain authentication timeout issue, where a critical domain controller in the primary office was experiencing intermittent connectivity failures. This caused authentication requests from remote office users to fail, resulting in their internet sessions being dropped. The issue was compounded by a lack of redundant authentication paths for the remote offices.

## Solution

1. Resolve the underlying network instability affecting the primary domain controller. 2. Implement redundant domain controllers or authentication servers in the network path for the remote offices to ensure failover capability. 3. Adjust authentication session timeout policies to be more tolerant of brief network hiccups, preventing immediate session termination.

## Ubuntu Value

The collective approach prevented siloed troubleshooting. By sharing the 'multi-domain' finding early, Network and App Support were directed to investigate the correct, interconnected systems. This allowed the team to quickly correlate network instability with application authentication failures, arriving at a complete root cause much faster than any single agent working alone.
