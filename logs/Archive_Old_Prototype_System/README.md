## New Logging System

The current system (Component 0: Investigation Logging) uses a different structure:

```
logs/
├── investigations/    # Per-investigation logs (JSON + MD)
├── orchestration/     # Ubuntu collaboration logs (JSON + MD)
├── sessions/          # Session summaries (JSON)
└── metrics/           # Daily aggregated metrics (JSON)
```

This new system is production-ready and captures:
- ReAct reasoning iterations
- Ubuntu collaboration events
- Session performance metrics
- Daily trend analysis
