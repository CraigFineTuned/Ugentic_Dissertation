# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251017_100132
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Since this is the first step in the investigation and the problem involves sporadic internet disconnections for remote office users, I need to start with foundational network connectivity tests. The focus areas (firewall, VPN concentrator, routing) require baseline network performance data during normal operation to compare against outage windows. A ping test to a reliable external host will establish current connectivity status and provide baseline latency/packet loss metrics.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "8.8.8.8"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "8.8.8.8",
  "packets_sent": 10,
  "packets_received": 10,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 5.69,
  "max_latency_ms": 71.53,
  "avg_latency_ms": 45.19,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test shows 0% packet loss and normal connectivity to 8.8.8.8 with average latency of 45.19ms. This indicates the network is currently stable with no active outage. However, since the reported issue occurs in 30-60 second drop patterns, this single successful test doesn't capture the intermittent problem. The high max latency (71.53ms) could indicate occasional congestion, but more continuous monitoring is needed.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The ping test shows 0% packet loss and normal connectivity to 8.8.8.8 with average latency of 45.19ms. This indicates the network is currently stable with no active outage. However, since the reported issue occurs in 30-60 second drop patterns, this single successful test doesn't capture the intermittent problem. The high max latency (71.53ms) could indicate occasional congestion, but more continuous monitoring is needed.
