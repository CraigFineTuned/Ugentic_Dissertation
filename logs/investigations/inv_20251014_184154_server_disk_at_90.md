**Duration:** 204.28 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Error in thought generation: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 6 column 51 (char 728)

**Action:** check_server_metrics
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T18:44:42.550324",
  "cpu_percent": 1.8,
  "memory_percent": 86.0,
  "memory_available_gb": 2.16,
  "memory_total_gb": 15.39,
  "disk_percent": 85.8,
  "disk_free_gb": 67.4,
  "status": "critical"
}
```

**Reflection:** The server's CPU usage is low, but its memory and disk usage are critical. The available memory and free disk space are insufficient.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The server's CPU usage is low, but its memory and disk usage are critical. The available memory and free disk space are insufficient.

## Final Response
