# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_230954
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** I'm investigating intermittent connectivity affecting multiple remote office users. The issue occurs every 2-3 hours with 30-60 second drops. Both DNS/firewall and VPN configurations are suspected. Since this affects multiple users and occurs at regular intervals, I suspect this might be related to service restarts, resource exhaustion, or scheduled maintenance activities. I need to check if any critical services are restarting on a regular basis that could cause these brief outages.

**Action:** check_service_status
**Parameters:** {
  "service_name": "VPN, firewall, and DNS services"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "service": "VPN, firewall, and DNS services",
  "running": true,
  "status": "active",
  "uptime_hours": 505,
  "restarts_today": 1
}
```

**Reflection:** The service status check shows that the core services (VPN, firewall, DNS) are currently running and have been active for a very long time (505 hours, or ~21 days). The single restart today does not align with a 2-3 hour pattern. This suggests that the services themselves are generally stable and not the direct source of frequent crashes or restarts.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The service status check shows that the core services (VPN, firewall, DNS) are currently running and have been active for a very long time (505 hours, or ~21 days). The single restart today does not align with a 2-3 hour pattern. This suggests that the services themselves are generally stable and not the direct source of frequent crashes or restarts.
