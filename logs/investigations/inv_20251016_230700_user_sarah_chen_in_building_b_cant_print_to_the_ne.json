However, my focus as Network Support requires me to verify network connectivity and accessibility. While the printer queue issue is a potential cause, I need to confirm whether Sarah's machine has proper network connectivity to the printer's IP address (192.168.1.157). A ping test will quickly determine if basic network connectivity exists between Building B and the printer.",
