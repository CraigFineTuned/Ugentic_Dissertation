The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, which aligns with the intermittent nature. Since this affects multiple users across remote offices, I need to start with broad network diagnostics to identify common points of failure. The first logical step is to test basic connectivity and latency to a reliable external host to establish baseline performance and identify if the issue is related to general internet connectivity or specific services.",
