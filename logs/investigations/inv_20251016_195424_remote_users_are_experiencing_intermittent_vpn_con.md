# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_195424
**Query:** Remote users are experiencing intermittent VPN connectivity issues. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support suspects user VPN configuration problems. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help. This is affecting multiple users across different departments who need stable remote access.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** To identify the root cause of intermittent VPN connectivity issues experienced by remote users, we need to investigate both user-specific factors and system-level metrics that could be influencing their connection stability. The recent findings suggest Network Support has already addressed potential DNS or firewall issues at the network level, but the problem persists across multiple departments with no correlation to standard troubleshooting steps like reconnecting or rebooting.

**Action:** ask_questions
**Parameters:** {
  "user_input": "Please describe any specific applications or services you were using right before your VPN connection dropped."
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tool": "ask_questions",
  "domain": "user_support",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "general_inquiry",
    "questions_asked": 0,
    "responses": [],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T19:54:48.600074",
    "context_gathered": false,
    "rag_enabled": true,
    "note": "No valid questions provided"
  }
}
```

**Reflection:** The expected outcome was to gather user-specific details about their activities prior to disconnection in order to identify if certain software is triggering the issue and guide further investigation into potential application conflicts with the VPN client.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The expected outcome was to gather user-specific details about their activities prior to disconnection in order to identify if certain software is triggering the issue and guide further investigation into potential application conflicts with the VPN client.
