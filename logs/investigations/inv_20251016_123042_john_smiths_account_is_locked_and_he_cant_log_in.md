## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user's account is locked and they cannot log in. This suggests a potential account lock due to too many failed login attempts, or a manual lock by an administrator. To investigate, I need to verify the account status and check if it's locked. I will use the `get_user_profile` tool to retrieve the user's account status and see if it indicates a locked account.

**Action:** get_user_profile
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "John Smith"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "John Smith",
  "username": "user_John Smith",
  "email": "John Smith@company.com",
  "department": "Marketing",
  "account_status": "locked",
  "last_login": "2025-10-16T08:30:00",
  "password_expires_days": 84,
  "groups": [
    "Domain Users",
    "VPN Users"
  ]
}
```
