# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_230944
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves multiple remote users experiencing intermittent disconnections every 2-3 hours, with the network team suspecting DNS or firewall issues and IT Support suspecting VPN configurations. Since the issue affects multiple users and is sporadic, I need to investigate network-level infrastructure rather than individual user configurations. The first logical step is to check the firewall rules since firewall issues could cause intermittent blocking of traffic patterns that occur every few hours (like session timeouts or policy refreshes). This is different from checking basic connectivity or DNS resolution.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 9
}
```

**Reflection:** The firewall data shows basic port allow/deny rules but no time-based restrictions or session timeout settings. Ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) are allowed from any source, while port 3389 (RDP) is blocked from external sources. There are 9 recent blocks, but the firewall configuration lacks the time-based rules or session management features that would explain the 2-3 hour interval pattern reported by users.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The firewall data shows basic port allow/deny rules but no time-based restrictions or session timeout settings. Ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 443 (HTTPS) are allowed from any source, while port 3389 (RDP) is blocked from external sources. There are 9 recent blocks, but the firewall configuration lacks the time-based rules or session management features that would explain the 2-3 hour interval pattern reported by users.
