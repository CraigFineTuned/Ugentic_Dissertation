## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user is experiencing an issue with accessing a shared drive. The knowledge base provides information on storage infrastructure, but does not directly address the specific problem of shared drive access. However, there are potential issues related to network connectivity and backup jobs that could indirectly affect this situation.

**Action:** check_server_logs
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "SharedDriveServer",
  "hours": 24
}

**Result:** âœ… Success

    }
  ],
  "top_error": "OutOfMemoryError"
}
```

**Reflection:** The logs indicate that the most frequent and severe issues are related to memory management, with two 'OutOfMemoryError' entries, one of which is classified as 'ERROR'. There are also some network connectivity issues such as 'ConnectionRefused', disk space warnings, and a database connection error. The recent errors suggest potential resource exhaustion or mismanagement on the SharedDriveServer.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The logs indicate that the most frequent and severe issues are related to memory management, with two 'OutOfMemoryError' entries, one of which is classified as 'ERROR'. There are also some network connectivity issues such as 'ConnectionRefused', disk space warnings, and a database connection error. The recent errors suggest potential resource exhaustion or mismanagement on the SharedDriveServer.
