Since the issue affects multiple users and is sporadic, I need to investigate network-level infrastructure rather than individual user configurations. The first logical step is to check the firewall rules since firewall issues could cause intermittent blocking of traffic patterns that occur every few hours (like session timeouts or policy refreshes). This is different from checking basic connectivity or DNS resolution.",
