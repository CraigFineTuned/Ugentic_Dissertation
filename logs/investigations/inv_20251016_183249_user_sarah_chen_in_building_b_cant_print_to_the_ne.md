**Duration:** 31.68 seconds
**Outcome:** success

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The investigation so far has focused on verifying network connectivity and printer configuration for Sarah Chen's device. The key context information suggests checking if her computer is properly connected to the office Wi-Fi and whether there are any error messages displayed when attempting to print.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 20
}
```

**Reflection:** The tool has revealed that while there are firewall rules allowing traffic on common ports used for printers (ports 22 and 80), there is an active deny rule blocking outbound traffic from external sources on port 3389, which is typically used for remote desktop connections. Additionally, several other ports commonly associated with printer services were found to be blocked recently.
