# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_194941
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** Service Desk Manager
**Started:** 2025-10-16T19:49:41.340448
**Duration:** 55.78 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** To identify the root cause of the intermittent internet disconnections experienced by remote office users, I need to investigate potential correlations between the disconnection spikes and specific times of day. Additionally, I should verify if all affected users report similar experiences regardless of their location or device type.

**Action:** get_sla_status
**Parameters:** {
  "ticket_id": "TKT-12345"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "ticket_id": "TKT-12345",
  "priority": "low",
  "sla_target_hours": 24,
  "ticket_age_hours": 33.04,
  "remaining_hours": 0,
  "sla_status": "breached",
  "percent_time_used": 137.7
}
```

**Reflection:** The SLA status for ticket TKT-12345 shows that it has breached its target, with a ticket age of 33.04 hours and no remaining time to meet the 24-hour SLA target. The percent_time_used is significantly higher than the SLA target, indicating that this ticket has been taking longer than expected to resolve.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** The investigation needs to determine if there is a correlation between the disconnections and specific times of day, as well as whether all users are experiencing similar issues regardless of their location or device type. This information will help narrow down potential causes and direct further troubleshooting efforts.

**Action:** get_team_availability
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T19:50:28.540149",
  "available_now": 1,
  "total_team_size": 3,
  "on_break": 0,
  "in_meeting": 1,
  "handling_tickets": 1,
  "shift_coverage": "full",
  "estimated_wait_time_minutes": 14
}
```

**Reflection:** The tool 'get_team_availability' provides information about the availability of team members during a specific time period. In this case, it indicates that out of a total team size of 3 members, 1 is currently available, 1 is in a meeting, and 1 is handling tickets. This suggests that there are limited resources available to address user issues during this observed disconnection spike.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The tool 'get_team_availability' provides information about the availability of team members during a specific time period. In this case, it indicates that out of a total team size of 3 members, 1 is currently available, 1 is in a meeting, and 1 is handling tickets. This suggests that there are limited resources available to address user issues during this observed disconnection spike.
