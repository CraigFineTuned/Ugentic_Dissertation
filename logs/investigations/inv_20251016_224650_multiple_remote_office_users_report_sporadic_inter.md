# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_224650
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves sporadic internet disconnections affecting multiple remote office users with a consistent pattern (30-60 second drops every 2-3 hours). Both DNS and firewall are suspected by the network team, while IT Support suspects VPN configurations. Since the issue affects multiple users and follows a predictable pattern, this suggests a systemic issue rather than individual user problems. I need to start with basic network connectivity testing to establish a baseline and rule out fundamental connectivity issues before diving into more complex DNS or firewall analysis.

**Action:** check_network_bandwidth
**Parameters:** {
  "target": "internet_gateway"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "interface": "eth0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T22:46:55.434072",
  "download_mbps": 96.66,
  "upload_mbps": 46.58,
  "latency_ms": 42.9,
  "packet_loss_percent": 1.53,
  "jitter_ms": 4.86,
  "status": "degraded"
}
```

**Reflection:** The bandwidth values (96.66 Mbps download, 46.58 Mbps upload) appear normal. However, the connection is in a 'degraded' status due to elevated latency (42.9 ms), packet loss (1.53%), and jitter (4.86 ms). These metrics confirm network performance issues during the test window, but the test represents a single point in time and does not capture the timing data for the reported disconnection events.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The bandwidth values (96.66 Mbps download, 46.58 Mbps upload) appear normal. However, the connection is in a 'degraded' status due to elevated latency (42.9 ms), packet loss (1.53%), and jitter (4.86 ms). These metrics confirm network performance issues during the test window, but the test represents a single point in time and does not capture the timing data for the reported disconnection events.
