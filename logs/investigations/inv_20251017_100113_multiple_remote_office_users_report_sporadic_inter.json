Both DNS/firewall and VPN configurations are suspected. Since the issue affects multiple users simultaneously and has a consistent pattern, this suggests a server-side or infrastructure issue rather than individual client problems. I need to start by checking server metrics to identify any resource exhaustion patterns that might correlate with the disconnection intervals.",
