# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251017_074436
**Query:** Finance department reports that the expense reporting application crashes immediately on startup for all users in that department. System logs show permission errors.
**Agent:** Infrastructure

**Duration:** 11.0 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves system-wide permission errors affecting all Finance department users when starting the expense reporting application. Since this affects all users in a department simultaneously, it suggests a broader infrastructure issue rather than individual user permissions. The logs show permission errors, but I need to determine if this is related to application services, database connectivity, or file system permissions. I should start by checking if the core application services are running properly, as a service failure could manifest as permission errors to end users.

**Action:** check_service_status
**Parameters:** {
  "service_name": "expense_reporting_app_services"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "service": "expense_reporting_app_services",
  "running": true,
  "status": "active",
  "uptime_hours": 232,
  "restarts_today": 1
}
```

**Reflection:** The core application service for expense reporting is running and healthy. Its status is 'active', it has significant uptime, and only one restart today, which does not indicate a critical failure. The issue is unlikely to be a simple service outage.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The core application service for expense reporting is running and healthy. Its status is 'active', it has significant uptime, and only one restart today, which does not indicate a critical failure. The issue is unlikely to be a simple service outage.
