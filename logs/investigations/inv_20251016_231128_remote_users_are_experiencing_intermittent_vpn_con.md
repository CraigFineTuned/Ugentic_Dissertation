# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_231128
**Query:** Remote users are experiencing intermittent VPN connectivity issues. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support suspects user VPN configuration problems. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help. This is affecting multiple users across different departments who need stable remote access.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The issue involves intermittent VPN drops affecting multiple users across different departments. Since the network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, I need to start by checking network-level components. The most logical starting point is to examine firewall rules since they could be timing out or intermittently blocking VPN traffic, which would explain the regular 2-3 hour pattern of 30-60 second drops.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 40
}
```

**Reflection:** The firewall rules show standard allow/deny configurations but do not contain any session timeout settings or VPN-specific rules. The firewall is actively blocking traffic (40 recent blocks) on ports including RDP (3389), SMB (445), and SQL (1433), but there are no rules or timeout values that would explain a 2-3 hour intermittent VPN disconnection pattern.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The firewall rules show standard allow/deny configurations but do not contain any session timeout settings or VPN-specific rules. The firewall is actively blocking traffic (40 recent blocks) on ports including RDP (3389), SMB (445), and SQL (1433), but there are no rules or timeout values that would explain a 2-3 hour intermittent VPN disconnection pattern.
