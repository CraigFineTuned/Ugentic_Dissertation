The problem involves sporadic disconnections every 2-3 hours lasting 30-60 seconds. I need to start with basic connectivity testing to establish a baseline and determine if this is a widespread network issue or localized to specific users/offices. Since this is a new investigation with no previous steps, I should begin with fundamental network diagnostics.",
