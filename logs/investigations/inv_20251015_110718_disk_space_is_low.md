**ID:** inv_20251015_110718
**Query:** disk space is low

**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the context, we currently have no prior findings and are in subtask mode. The focus is on assessing application usage and data storage, identifying large database files, and optimizing application performance to address the disk space issue.

**Action:** check_app_database_performance
**Parameters:** {
  "app_name": "unknown"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "application": "unknown",
  "avg_query_time_ms": 3018.07,
  "slow_queries": 13,
  "active_connections": 71,
  "max_connections": 100,
  "connection_percent": 46,
  "status": "poor"
}
```

**Reflection:** The database performance check indicates poor overall performance with a high average query time and multiple slow queries. The connection usage is currently at 46%, which is below the max, but there are still 13 slow queries that could be impacting performance.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The database performance check indicates poor overall performance with a high average query time and multiple slow queries. The connection usage is currently at 46%, which is below the max, but there are still 13 slow queries that could be impacting performance.

## Final Response
