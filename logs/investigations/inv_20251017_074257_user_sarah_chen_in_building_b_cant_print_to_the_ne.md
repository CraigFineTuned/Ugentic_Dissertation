**Query:** User Sarah Chen in Building B can't print to the networked printer. She can connect to it but documents won't print. What's wrong?
**Agent:** Infrastructure

**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user can connect to the printer but documents won't print, which suggests the issue is not basic connectivity but rather a service or application-level problem. The printer service on the print server might be malfunctioning or stopped. Since the knowledge base mentions checking application-specific settings and services, I should verify the status of the print spooler service on the print server.

**Action:** check_service_status
**Parameters:** {
  "service_name": "spooler"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "service": "spooler",
  "running": true,
  "status": "active",
  "uptime_hours": 426,
  "restarts_today": 0
}
```

**Reflection:** The print spooler service is running normally and has been stable for an extended period (426 hours) with no recent restarts. This observation directly contradicts the initial hypothesis that the spooler service was stopped, unstable, or in an error state.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The print spooler service is running normally and has been stable for an extended period (426 hours) with no recent restarts. This observation directly contradicts the initial hypothesis that the spooler service was stopped, unstable, or in an error state.
