# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_231044
**Query:** Remote users are experiencing intermittent VPN connectivity issues. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support suspects user VPN configuration problems. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help. This is affecting multiple users across different departments who need stable remote access.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves intermittent VPN connectivity drops affecting multiple users across different departments. The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, while IT Support suspects user configuration problems. Since the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) don't help, this suggests a systemic issue rather than individual user problems. I need to start with basic network connectivity tests to establish a baseline before diving deeper into DNS or firewall analysis. The ping test will help determine if there are fundamental connectivity issues to the VPN gateway.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "vpn_gateway"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "vpn_gateway",
  "packets_sent": 10,
  "packets_received": 10,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 10.45,
  "max_latency_ms": 92.94,
  "avg_latency_ms": 42.09,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test shows the VPN gateway is reachable with 0% packet loss and an average latency of 42.09 ms. While the maximum latency spike (92.94 ms) is high, the test does not show the intermittent, sustained packet loss or latency spikes over a 2-3 hour period that was expected to confirm a network-level issue.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The ping test shows the VPN gateway is reachable with 0% packet loss and an average latency of 42.09 ms. While the maximum latency spike (92.94 ms) is high, the test does not show the intermittent, sustained packet loss or latency spikes over a 2-3 hour period that was expected to confirm a network-level issue.
