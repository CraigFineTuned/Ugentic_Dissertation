Since this is affecting multiple users and not resolved by standard troubleshooting, it's likely a server-side issue rather than individual user configurations. The pattern (30-60 second drops every 2-3 hours) suggests a potential service restart, resource exhaustion, or scheduled maintenance. I need to start by checking the VPN service status and health metrics to identify any patterns or issues.",
