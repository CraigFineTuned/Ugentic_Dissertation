The prior findings indicate that network support has already investigated, but the specific cause is not yet identified. The focus is on user-specific issues and account management, suggesting the problem might stem from user account configuration, permissions, or software installation. We need to investigate the user's VPN client setup, account status, and permissions to pinpoint the issue. We haven't yet gathered details from the affected users about their specific environment, which is crucial for troubleshooting.",
