This suggests the issue might be related to the network connectivity between John Smith's device and the printer located in Building A.  I should investigate the network path to the printer to identify any potential problems. Specifically, I need to verify the status of the network devices in Building A, particularly the switch that the printer is connected to. Since the problem is user access, I should start by checking the network connectivity from a device in Building A to the printer.  The network topology diagram shows that Building A has a switch. I should check the status of that switch.",
