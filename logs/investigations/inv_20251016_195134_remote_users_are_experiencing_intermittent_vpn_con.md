# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_195134
**Query:** Remote users are experiencing intermittent VPN connectivity issues. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support suspects user VPN configuration problems. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help. This is affecting multiple users across different departments who need stable remote access.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Based on the user input and knowledge base, the intermittent VPN connectivity issues every 2-3 hours with drops lasting 30-60 seconds suggest a configuration problem rather than DNS or firewall issues. The network team suspects DNS/firewall but IT Support believes it's likely a misconfigured VPN client setting causing the periodic disconnects.

**Action:** ask_questions
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "all_remote_users"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tool": "ask_questions",
  "domain": "user_support",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "all_remote_users",
    "questions_asked": 0,
    "responses": [],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T19:52:18.176276",
    "context_gathered": false,
    "rag_enabled": true,
    "note": "No valid questions provided"
  }
}
```

**Reflection:** The tool was expected to provide insights into VPN client settings, recent policy changes, and any configuration updates that could explain the intermittent connectivity issue. However, no valid questions were provided to gather information from the user.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The tool was expected to provide insights into VPN client settings, recent policy changes, and any configuration updates that could explain the intermittent connectivity issue. However, no valid questions were provided to gather information from the user.
