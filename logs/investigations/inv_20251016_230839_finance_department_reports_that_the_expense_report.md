# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_230839
**Query:** Finance department reports that the expense reporting application crashes immediately on startup for all users in that department. System logs show permission errors.
**Agent:** IT Support
**Started:** 2025-10-16T23:08:39.754968
**Duration:** 7.67 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The prior findings indicate App Support has already investigated the application crash issue. My focus now is on coordinating user communication and verifying resolution across the finance department. Since the problem involves permission errors and affects all finance users, I need to verify that the fixes have been applied and test with actual finance department users before communicating status.

**Action:** check_software_installation
**Parameters:** {
  "user_department": "finance"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "default_user",
  "software": "default_software",
  "installed": true,
  "version": "9.4.58",
  "install_date": "2025-06-15",
  "license_valid": true,
  "needs_update": false
}
```

**Reflection:** The tool reports a successful installation of the software for a default user. The version (9.4.58) is installed, the license is valid, and no update is needed. However, this generic check does not confirm the status for the specific finance department users or the specific expense reporting application that was the focus of the expected outcome.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The tool reports a successful installation of the software for a default user. The version (9.4.58) is installed, the license is valid, and no update is needed. However, this generic check does not confirm the status for the specific finance department users or the specific expense reporting application that was the focus of the expected outcome.
