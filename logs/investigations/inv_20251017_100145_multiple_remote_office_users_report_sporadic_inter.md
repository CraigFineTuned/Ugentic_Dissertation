# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251017_100145
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves sporadic internet disconnections for remote VPN users. Since the network team has already investigated DNS/firewall and suspects VPN configurations, I need to start by testing the VPN connections for affected users to understand the current connection status and identify any patterns in failure modes. This will provide baseline data before diving deeper into configuration comparisons.

**Action:** test_remote_access
**Parameters:** {
  "user": "affected_user_sample"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "default_user",
  "vpn_status": "connected",
  "can_access": true,
  "ip_address": "10.0.58.174",
  "connection_time": "2025-10-17T10:01:49.077685",
  "bandwidth": "58 Mbps",
  "error": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The single test result shows a successful, stable VPN connection at the moment of testing. It does not capture the reported intermittent drops (30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours), which require continuous monitoring over a longer period to be observed.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The single test result shows a successful, stable VPN connection at the moment of testing. It does not capture the reported intermittent drops (30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours), which require continuous monitoring over a longer period to be observed.
