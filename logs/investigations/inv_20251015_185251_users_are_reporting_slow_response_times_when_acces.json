This suggests a potential performance issue with the server hosting the portal or the network connectivity to it. The network topology diagram in the knowledge base provides a high-level overview of the network infrastructure. To investigate, I should start by measuring the server's response time to see if there's a latency issue. Then, I should check the server metrics to see if CPU, memory, or disk usage are unusually high. If those are high, I can check the logs for errors or patterns that might indicate the cause of the slow response times. If the server metrics look normal, I can check the network connectivity to the server to rule out network-related issues.",
