# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_224711
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves sporadic internet disconnections every 2-3 hours. Since the network team suspects DNS or firewall issues and IT Support suspects VPN configs, I need to start by checking the most critical infrastructure component that could cause these symptoms. DNS failures would manifest as inability to resolve websites, while firewall issues could cause session timeouts. Starting with DNS since it's often the root cause of intermittent connectivity issues.

**Action:** check_dns_resolution
**Parameters:** {
  "domain": "google.com"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "domain": "google.com",
  "ip_address": "192.178.54.110",
  "resolution_time_ms": 261.51,
  "status": "working"
}
```

**Reflection:** DNS resolution for google.com is working correctly, with a successful response and an acceptable resolution time of 261.51 ms. This single data point does not show any failure or timeout.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** DNS resolution for google.com is working correctly, with a successful response and an acceptable resolution time of 261.51 ms. This single data point does not show any failure or timeout.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': 'DNS resolution for google.com is working correctly, with a successful response and an acceptable resolution time of 261.51 ms. This single data point does not show any failure or timeout.', 'required_agents': [], 'investigation_history': [{'iteration': 0, 'tool_used': 'check_dns_resolution', 'finding': 'DNS resolution for google.com is working correctly, with a successful response and an acceptable resolution time of 261.51 ms.
