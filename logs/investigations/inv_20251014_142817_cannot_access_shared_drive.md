## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user cannot access a shared drive, which suggests an issue related to network connectivity, storage availability, or possibly a configuration problem. The context provides information on infrastructure and application dependencies that could be relevant to diagnose the problem.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "shared_drive_server",
  "count": 10
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "shared_drive_server",
  "packets_sent": 10,
  "packets_received": 9,
  "packet_loss_percent": 10.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 11.64,
  "max_latency_ms": 88.92,
  "avg_latency_ms": 56.08,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test shows that packets are lost at 10.0% and the average latency is 56.08 ms, which indicates some network connectivity issues but not a severe one.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The ping test shows that packets are lost at 10.0% and the average latency is 56.08 ms, which indicates some network connectivity issues but not a severe one.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': 'The ping test shows that packets are lost at 10.0% and the average latency is 56.08 ms, which indicates some network connectivity issues but not a severe one.', 'required_agents': ['agent2', 'agent3'], 'investigation_history': [{'iteration': 0, 'tool_used': 'ping_test', 'finding': 'The ping test shows that packets are lost at 10.0% and the average latency is 56.08 ms, which indicates some network connectivity issues but not a severe one.'}], 'lead_agent': 'Network Support'}
