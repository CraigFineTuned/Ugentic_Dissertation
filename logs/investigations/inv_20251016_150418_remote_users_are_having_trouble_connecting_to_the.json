The network topology diagram shows the basic network architecture, including the firewall, router, switches, and user access layers.  The VPN support manual outlines steps to grant VPN access and common VPN issues.  Since the user is having trouble connecting, the first step is to verify basic connectivity and the status of the VPN server.  The current information doesn't specify the exact nature of the problem (e.g., error messages, specific symptoms), so a broad investigation is needed.  Since the user is having trouble connecting, it's likely a network-related issue, so tools that can test network connectivity and path are appropriate.",
