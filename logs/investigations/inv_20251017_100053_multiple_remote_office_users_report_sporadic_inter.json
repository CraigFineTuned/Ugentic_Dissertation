The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, while IT Support suspects VPN configurations. Since the issue is intermittent and affects multiple users, I need to start with basic connectivity testing to establish a baseline. The ping_test tool can help determine if the connectivity loss is occurring at the network layer and measure packet loss patterns that might correlate with the reported timeframes.",
