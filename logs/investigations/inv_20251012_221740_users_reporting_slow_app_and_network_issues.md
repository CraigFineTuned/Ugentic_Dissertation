## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The users are reporting slow app and network issues. Based on the context, we can infer that these issues might be related to application performance, which could involve both application health checks and network diagnostics.

**Action:** check_app_response_time
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** ‚ùå Failed
**Error:** Tool check_app_response_time not found in network registry

**Reflection:** The tool expected to measure latency was not found in the network registry, which indicates that it cannot be used for this particular task. Other tools available can still be utilized to diagnose potential issues.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The tool expected to measure latency was not found in the network registry, which indicates that it cannot be used for this particular task. Other tools available can still be utilized to diagnose potential issues.

## Final Response
