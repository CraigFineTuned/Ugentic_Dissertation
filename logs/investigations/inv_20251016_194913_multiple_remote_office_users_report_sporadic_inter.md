# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_194913
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** IT Support
**Started:** 2025-10-16T19:49:13.660514
**Duration:** 27.68 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Based on the context and recent findings, the next step is to verify if all remote office users have installed the latest VPN client updates. This will help determine if outdated software could be contributing to the sporadic internet disconnections experienced by the users.

**Action:** ask_questions
**Parameters:** {
  "user_ids": [
    "all_remote_office_users"
  ]
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tool": "ask_questions",
  "domain": "user_support",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "general_inquiry",
    "questions_asked": 0,
    "responses": [],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16T19:49:34.373269",
    "context_gathered": false,
    "rag_enabled": true,
    "note": "No valid questions provided"
  }
}
```

**Reflection:** The 'ask_questions' tool was invoked to gather information about the user's VPN client version in order to determine if an outdated software is causing the issue.

## Collaboration Decision
