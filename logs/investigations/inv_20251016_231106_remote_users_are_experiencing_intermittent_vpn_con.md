# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_231106
**Query:** Remote users are experiencing intermittent VPN connectivity issues. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support suspects user VPN configuration problems. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help. This is affecting multiple users across different departments who need stable remote access.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves intermittent VPN connectivity drops affecting multiple users across different departments. Since this is affecting multiple users and not resolved by standard troubleshooting, it's likely a server-side issue rather than individual user configurations. The pattern (30-60 second drops every 2-3 hours) suggests a potential service restart, resource exhaustion, or scheduled maintenance. I need to start by checking the VPN service status and health metrics to identify any patterns or issues.

**Action:** check_service_status
**Parameters:** {
  "service_name": "VPN service (or equivalent name from context)"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "service": "VPN service (or equivalent name from context)",
  "running": true,
  "status": "active",
  "uptime_hours": 107,
  "restarts_today": 0
}
```

**Reflection:** The VPN service has been running continuously for 107 hours (over 4 days) with no restarts today. This indicates high stability and does not show the expected 2-3 hour restart pattern. The issue is unlikely to be frequent service crashes.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The VPN service has been running continuously for 107 hours (over 4 days) with no restarts today. This indicates high stability and does not show the expected 2-3 hour restart pattern. The issue is unlikely to be frequent service crashes.
