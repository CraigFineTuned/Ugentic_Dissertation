# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_224718
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** IT Support
**Started:** 2025-10-16T22:47:18.756113
**Duration:** 18.06 seconds
**Outcome:** success

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves sporadic VPN disconnections affecting multiple remote users. The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support believes it's related to user VPN configurations. Since no previous investigation steps have been taken, I need to start by gathering baseline information about the affected users' VPN setups and connection statuses. The key questions focus on VPN client versions, configuration parameters, and client-side logs during disconnections. I'll begin by testing remote access for a representative user to understand the current VPN behavior and gather initial connection data.

**Action:** test_remote_access
**Parameters:** {
  "user": "representative_affected_user"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "default_user",
  "vpn_status": "connected",
  "can_access": true,
  "ip_address": "10.0.58.174",
  "connection_time": "2025-10-16T22:47:26.650932",
  "bandwidth": "58 Mbps",
  "error": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The VPN diagnostic test shows a currently healthy connection. The user's VPN is connected, they can access resources, and there are no active errors. This indicates the problem is not a persistent outage but likely an intermittent disconnection or an issue that occurs under specific conditions not captured by this single-point test.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** The recent VPN test showed a currently healthy connection, but the problem is sporadic. Since the network team suspects DNS/firewall while IT suspects VPN configs, I need to gather more user-specific information to identify patterns. The get_user_profile tool can provide details about user departments, locations, and account status that might reveal correlations between affected users.

**Action:** get_user_profile
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "affected_user_sample"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "affected_user_sample",
  "username": "user_affected_user_sample",
  "email": "affected_user_sample@company.com",
  "department": "IT",
  "account_status": "disabled",
  "last_login": "2025-10-16T08:30:00",
  "password_expires_days": 85,
  "groups": [
    "Domain Users",
    "VPN Users"
  ]
}
```

**Reflection:** The tool successfully retrieved the profile for a sample affected user. The user is in the IT department, has a disabled account status, and belongs to the 'VPN Users' group. The 'disabled' account status is a critical finding, as it would prevent login and cause disconnection. The user's department and group memberships are also relevant characteristics to check across other affected users.
