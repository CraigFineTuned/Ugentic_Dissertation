## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** This is the initial investigation step for a network connectivity issue affecting multiple remote office users. The problem involves sporadic disconnections every 2-3 hours lasting 30-60 seconds. I need to start with basic connectivity testing to establish a baseline and determine if this is a widespread network issue or localized to specific users/offices. Since this is a new investigation with no previous steps, I should begin with fundamental network diagnostics.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "target": "8.8.8.8",
  "count": "10"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "packets_sent": 10,
  "packets_received": 10,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 8.66,
  "max_latency_ms": 91.42,
  "avg_latency_ms": 61.06,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test to localhost shows 0% packet loss and successful connectivity, which meets the expectation of normal network stability. However, the latency metrics show significant variation (8.66ms min to 91.42ms max) with a high average latency of 61.06ms for localhost, which is abnormal as localhost traffic should typically have sub-millisecond latency.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The ping test to localhost shows 0% packet loss and successful connectivity, which meets the expectation of normal network stability. However, the latency metrics show significant variation (8.66ms min to 91.42ms max) with a high average latency of 61.06ms for localhost, which is abnormal as localhost traffic should typically have sub-millisecond latency.
