**Query:** I cannot access the shared drive

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the problem, it is possible that either there are network issues preventing clients from accessing the shared drive server or security settings on firewalls could be blocking access. We need to first verify if the network connection is stable between clients and the shared_drive_server.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "shared_drive_server",
  "count": 10
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "shared_drive_server",
  "packets_sent": 10,
  "packets_received": 8,
  "packet_loss_percent": 20.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 21.22,
  "max_latency_ms": 99.1,
  "avg_latency_ms": 42.39,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test results show that the network connection between clients and 'shared_drive_server' has a significant packet loss of 20% and an average latency of 42.39 milliseconds, which are not within normal ranges.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The ping test results show that the network connection between clients and 'shared_drive_server' has a significant packet loss of 20% and an average latency of 42.39 milliseconds, which are not within normal ranges.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': "The ping test results show that the network connection between clients and 'shared_drive_server' has a significant packet loss of 20% and an average latency of 42.39 milliseconds, which are not within normal ranges.", 'required_agents': ['network_admin', 'sysadmin'], 'investigation_history': [{'iteration': 0, 'tool_used': 'ping_test', 'finding': "The ping test results show that the network connection between clients and 'shared_drive_server' has a significant packet loss of 20% and an average latency of 42.39 milliseconds, which are not within"}], 'lead_agent': 'Network Support'}
