# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251014_184616
**Query:** Server disk at 90%
**Agent:** App Support
**Started:** 2025-10-14T18:46:16.909098
**Duration:** 151.63 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the server disk is at 90%, we need to investigate potential storage inefficiencies, such as excessive logging and redundant backups. We will start by checking if there are any applications generating large logs that can be archived or rotated.

**Action:** query_app_logs
**Parameters:** {
  "app_name": "*",
  "user_id": "",
  "hours": 24
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
