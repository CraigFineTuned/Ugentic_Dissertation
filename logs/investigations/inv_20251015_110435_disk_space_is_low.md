**Query:** disk space is low

**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user reports that the disk space is low. The context provides a document on IT policies and procedures, but no specific policy related to disk management has been found yet. There is also a network topology diagram, which does not directly relate to the current issue of low disk space. The Ubuntu Collaboration Framework guide might be useful for understanding how collaboration is handled in the organization, but it’s not immediately relevant.

**Action:** check_disk_space
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "Server_A"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "server": "Server_A",
  "disks": [
    {
      "device": "C:\\",
      "mountpoint": "C:\\",
      "total_gb": 475.87,
      "used_gb": 413.98,
      "free_gb": 61.88,
      "percent": 87.0,
      "status": "warning"
    }
  ],
  "critical_disks": []
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation indicates that the 'C:\' drive on Server_A is running low with only 61.88 GB of free space, which constitutes 87.0% usage. There are no critical disks reported.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation indicates that the 'C:\' drive on Server_A is running low with only 61.88 GB of free space, which constitutes 87.0% usage. There are no critical disks reported.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': "The observation indicates that the 'C:\\' drive on Server_A is running low with only 61.88 GB of free space, which constitutes 87.0% usage. There are no critical disks reported.", 'required_agents': ['storage_admin', 'sysadmin'], 'investigation_history': [{'iteration': 0, 'tool_used': 'check_disk_space', 'finding': "The observation indicates that the 'C:\\' drive on Server_A is running low with only 61.88 GB of free space, which constitutes 87.0% usage.
