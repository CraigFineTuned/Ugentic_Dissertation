This suggests a potential issue with the printer's service/application layer rather than the physical network connectivity itself. The recent knowledge base articles emphasize checking network performance (slow), server reachability (cannot access specific server/application), and general network access issues which seem less relevant here. However, investigating the application or service layer where printing occurs could reveal misconfigurations or errors preventing document processing.",
