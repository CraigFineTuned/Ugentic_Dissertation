## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user is reporting slow application performance and network issues. The knowledge base provides a playbook for diagnosing these types of issues, suggesting that the first step should be to verify the scope of the issue by checking if it affects one or multiple users, when it started, and what specific actions are slow. This information will help us determine the next steps in the investigation.

**Action:** check_app_availability
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** ‚ùå Failed
**Error:** Tool check_app_availability not found in infrastructure registry

**Reflection:** The observation indicates that the 'check_app_availability' tool is not available in the infrastructure registry, which means we cannot directly determine if the application is affected for all users or just a specific user. However, other tools are available to gather more information about the issue.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation indicates that the 'check_app_availability' tool is not available in the infrastructure registry, which means we cannot directly determine if the application is affected for all users or just a specific user. However, other tools are available to gather more information about the issue.
