Since this affects all users in a department simultaneously, it suggests a broader infrastructure issue rather than individual user permissions. The logs show permission errors, but I need to determine if this is related to application services, database connectivity, or file system permissions. I should start by checking if the core application services are running properly, as a service failure could manifest as permission errors to end users.",
