## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Error in thought generation: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 6 column 51 (char 607)

**Action:** check_server_metrics
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-15T13:33:57.391282",
  "cpu_percent": 21.7,
  "memory_percent": 92.5,
  "memory_available_gb": 1.16,
  "memory_total_gb": 15.39,
  "disk_percent": 87.0,
  "disk_free_gb": 61.99,
  "status": "critical"
}
```

**Reflection:** The server is under heavy memory and disk usage, which could lead to performance degradation or system instability.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The server is under heavy memory and disk usage, which could lead to performance degradation or system instability.

## Final Response
