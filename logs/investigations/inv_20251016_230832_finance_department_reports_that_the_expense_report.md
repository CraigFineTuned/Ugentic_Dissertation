# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_230832
**Query:** Finance department reports that the expense reporting application crashes immediately on startup for all users in that department. System logs show permission errors.
**Agent:** App Support
**Started:** 2025-10-16T23:08:32.595445
**Duration:** 7.16 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Since this is the first investigation step and we're focusing on application-specific issues after infrastructure fixes, I need to start by checking if the application is actually available and responding. The Finance department reports crashes on startup for all users, so verifying current availability status is the logical first step before diving into more specific logs or performance metrics.

**Action:** check_app_availability
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "application": "default_app",
  "available": true,
  "status": "online",
  "response_time_ms": 494.63,
  "uptime_percent": 97.08,
  "last_outage": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The application is confirmed to be online and available, with a high uptime percentage. This refutes the hypothesis of complete unavailability. The observed high response time (494.63 ms) could indicate performance degradation or resource strain, which might be a contributing factor to the permission errors mentioned in the system logs, even though the application itself is not crashed.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The application is confirmed to be online and available, with a high uptime percentage. This refutes the hypothesis of complete unavailability. The observed high response time (494.63 ms) could indicate performance degradation or resource strain, which might be a contributing factor to the permission errors mentioned in the system logs, even though the application itself is not crashed.
