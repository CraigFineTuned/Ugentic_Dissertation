## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user reported that the disk space is low. The context provides information about IT policies and procedures, network topology, and a Ubuntu collaboration framework. Given the problem statement, we should focus on checking the current disk usage to identify any issues.

**Action:** check_disk_space
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "Infrastructure"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "Infrastructure",
  "disks": [
    {
      "device": "C:\\",
      "mountpoint": "C:\\",
      "total_gb": 475.87,
      "used_gb": 413.69,
      "free_gb": 62.18,
      "percent": 86.9,
      "status": "warning"
    }
  ],
  "critical_disks": []
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation shows that the drive C:\ on the server 'Infrastructure' is currently at 86.9% usage, with only 62.18 GB free space remaining. This indicates a low disk space issue.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation shows that the drive C:\ on the server 'Infrastructure' is currently at 86.9% usage, with only 62.18 GB free space remaining. This indicates a low disk space issue.

## Final Response
