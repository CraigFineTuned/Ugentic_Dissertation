# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251017_100053
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves intermittent connectivity affecting multiple remote users with a consistent pattern (30-60 second drops every 2-3 hours). The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, while IT Support suspects VPN configurations. Since the issue is intermittent and affects multiple users, I need to start with basic connectivity testing to establish a baseline. The ping_test tool can help determine if the connectivity loss is occurring at the network layer and measure packet loss patterns that might correlate with the reported timeframes.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "target_host": "google.com",
  "count": 50
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "packets_sent": 50,
  "packets_received": 44,
  "packet_loss_percent": 12.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 11.95,
  "max_latency_ms": 98.55,
  "avg_latency_ms": 59.4,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test shows significant packet loss (12%) and high, variable latency (average 59.4 ms, max 98.55 ms) to the localhost. This indicates a network-level performance issue on the local machine itself, such as a saturated network interface, high CPU load affecting the network stack, or a local firewall/security software interfering.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** The ping test revealed significant packet loss and variable latency, confirming there's a network-level issue. Since the problem affects multiple remote office users and occurs on a regular 2-3 hour cycle, this suggests a systemic issue rather than individual VPN config problems. The network team suspects DNS or firewall, which haven't been tested yet. I need to investigate DNS resolution since it's a suspected cause and would provide different information than the connectivity testing done with ping_test.

**Action:** check_dns_resolution
**Parameters:** {
  "domain": "google.com"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "domain": "google.com",
  "ip_address": "142.251.47.174",
  "resolution_time_ms": 28.99,
  "status": "working"
}
```

**Reflection:** The DNS resolution test shows successful and fast resolution (28.99ms) for google.com, indicating DNS infrastructure is currently working normally. This single successful test doesn't capture the intermittent 2-3 hour outage pattern mentioned in the hypothesis.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The DNS resolution test shows successful and fast resolution (28.99ms) for google.com, indicating DNS infrastructure is currently working normally. This single successful test doesn't capture the intermittent 2-3 hour outage pattern mentioned in the hypothesis.
