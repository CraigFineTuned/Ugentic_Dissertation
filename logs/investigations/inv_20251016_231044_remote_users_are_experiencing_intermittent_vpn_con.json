The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, while IT Support suspects user configuration problems. Since the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) don't help, this suggests a systemic issue rather than individual user problems. I need to start with basic network connectivity tests to establish a baseline before diving deeper into DNS or firewall analysis. The ping test will help determine if there are fundamental connectivity issues to the VPN gateway.",
