# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_224752
**Query:** Remote users are experiencing intermittent VPN connectivity issues. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support suspects user VPN configuration problems. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help. This is affecting multiple users across different departments who need stable remote access.
**Agent:** Network Support

**Duration:** 14.03 seconds
**Outcome:** success

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The issue involves intermittent VPN drops affecting multiple users across different departments. Since the network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, I should start by testing DNS resolution since DNS problems can cause intermittent connectivity issues. The knowledge base mentions verifying DNS resolution as part of network layer troubleshooting, and DNS issues could explain the periodic disconnections.

**Action:** check_dns_resolution
**Parameters:** {
  "domain": "internal.company.domain"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "domain": "internal.company.domain",
  "error": "[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed",
  "status": "failed"
}
```

**Reflection:** The DNS resolution test for 'internal.company.domain' failed completely with error '[Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed', indicating that DNS is not working at all for this internal domain. This is more severe than intermittent failures - it's a complete DNS resolution failure that would prevent VPN connections from establishing or maintaining properly.
