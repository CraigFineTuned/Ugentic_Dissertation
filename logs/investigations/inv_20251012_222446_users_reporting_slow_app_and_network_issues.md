# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251012_222446
**Query:** users reporting slow app and network issues
**Agent:** Network Support
**Started:** 2025-10-12T22:24:46.102697
**Duration:** 89.63 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the slow app and network issues reported by users, we need to first rule out any network-related causes. We should start by checking if there are any known network outages or downtimes, ensuring that the network bandwidth is sufficient for current usage, and examining recent changes in network configurations.

**Action:** check_network_bandwidth
**Parameters:** {
  "interface": "eth0"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "interface": "eth0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T22:25:37.802358",
  "download_mbps": 69.66,
  "upload_mbps": 29.47,
  "latency_ms": 40.72,
  "packet_loss_percent": 4.72,
  "jitter_ms": 2.2,
  "status": "poor"
}
```

**Reflection:** The network bandwidth on interface eth0 is currently insufficient for the users' needs, as indicated by the download and upload speeds. The latency is also relatively high, which can impact user experience.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The network bandwidth on interface eth0 is currently insufficient for the users' needs, as indicated by the download and upload speeds. The latency is also relatively high, which can impact user experience.
