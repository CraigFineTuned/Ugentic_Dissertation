## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Based on the user input and knowledge base, Sarah Chen can connect to the networked printer but documents are not printing. This suggests a potential local print spooler issue rather than a network connectivity problem. To further diagnose, we should verify that the printer is properly installed and configured on her workstation, check if there are any error messages in the print queue, and ensure the correct drivers are installed.

**Action:** get_recent_tickets
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "Sarah Chen"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "Sarah Chen",
  "total_tickets": 2,
  "open_tickets": 1,
  "tickets": [
    {
      "ticket_id": "TKT-1000",
      "user_id": "Sarah Chen",
      "subject": "Password reset needed",
      "status": "open",
      "priority": "low",
      "created": "2025-10-17T07:52:26.161722",

    },
    {
      "ticket_id": "TKT-1001",
      "user_id": "Sarah Chen",
      "subject": "Cannot access shared drive",
      "status": "in_progress",

    }
  ]
}
