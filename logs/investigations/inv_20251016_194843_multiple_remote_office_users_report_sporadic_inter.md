# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_194843
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** Network Support

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** To identify the root cause of the intermittent internet disconnections reported by remote office users, I need to investigate potential network infrastructure issues that could cause sporadic connectivity problems. Recent findings suggest a focus on DNS/firewall configurations and recent changes, so exploring network bandwidth utilization patterns may reveal clues about periodic performance degradation.

**Action:** check_network_bandwidth
**Parameters:** {
  "interval": "1h",
  "duration": "24h"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "interface": "eth0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T19:49:06.541158",
  "download_mbps": 52.55,
  "upload_mbps": 28.77,
  "latency_ms": 35.79,
  "packet_loss_percent": 2.52,
  "jitter_ms": 2.91,
  "status": "poor"
}
```

**Reflection:** The network bandwidth data shows significant packet loss and jitter, which could be contributing to the intermittent connectivity issues reported.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The network bandwidth data shows significant packet loss and jitter, which could be contributing to the intermittent connectivity issues reported.
