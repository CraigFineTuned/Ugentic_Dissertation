**ID:** inv_20251015_113503
**Query:** user forgot password
**Agent:** IT Support
**Started:** 2025-10-15T11:35:03.231813
**Duration:** 158.98 seconds
**Outcome:** success

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the context, we need to first determine if the user's account has been locked due to failed login attempts and whether there are any policies preventing a password reset. This will help us understand the root cause of the problem.

**Action:** get_user_profile
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "user_12345"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "username": "user_user_12345",
  "email": "user_12345@company.com",
  "department": "Finance",
  "account_status": "active",
  "last_login": "2025-10-15T11:35:51.375903",
  "password_expires_days": 57,
  "groups": [
    "Domain Users",
    "VPN Users"
  ]
}
```

**Reflection:** The user's account is active and has not been locked. The last login was on 2025-10-15T11:35:51.375903, and the password will expire in 57 days. The user belongs to 'Domain Users' and 'VPN Users' groups.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** From the context, we know that the user's account is active and not locked. The next step is to check if there are any policies or restrictions preventing a password reset.

**Action:** check_user_permissions
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "user_12345"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "resource": "default_resource",
  "has_access": false,
  "permission_level": null,
  "granted_by": null,
  "expires": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The user does not have the necessary access to reset their own password, and there are no specific permission levels or expiration times defined for this action.
