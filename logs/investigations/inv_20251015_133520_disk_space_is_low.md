**ID:** inv_20251015_133520
**Query:** disk space is low

**Duration:** 99.72 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem is disk space low, and the focus of the investigation is on reviewing application and database performance to identify potential issues causing excessive disk usage. We need to check if any applications are running out of storage space, whether recent updates or changes have affected disk space, and if there are large files or logs that can be archived or removed.

**Action:** check_app_database_performance
**Parameters:** {
  "app_name": "primary_app",
  "plan_id": "App_Support_20251015_133520"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "application": "primary_app",
  "avg_query_time_ms": 168.06,
  "slow_queries": 0,
  "active_connections": 34,
  "max_connections": 100,
  "connection_percent": 40,
  "status": "degraded"
}
```

**Reflection:** The application 'primary_app' is currently experiencing degraded performance. The average query time is 168.06 milliseconds, and the active connections are at 40% of the maximum allowed connections. There are no slow queries being identified, which might suggest that the issues are not related to a few long-running queries.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The application 'primary_app' is currently experiencing degraded performance. The average query time is 168.06 milliseconds, and the active connections are at 40% of the maximum allowed connections. There are no slow queries being identified, which might suggest that the issues are not related to a few long-running queries.

## Final Response
