# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251014_185307
**Query:** Disk space low
**Agent:** Infrastructure
**Started:** 2025-10-14T18:53:07.231638
**Duration:** 214.98 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user reported that the disk space is low. The context provides a relevant section from the Infrastructure Handbook which outlines steps to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to low memory available, including using tools like `check_server_resources` to verify memory usage. However, since we are dealing with disk space rather than memory, we should focus on checking the disk usage first.

**Action:** check_disk_space
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "example_server"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "example_server",
  "disks": [
    {
      "device": "C:\\",
      "mountpoint": "C:\\",
      "total_gb": 475.87,
      "used_gb": 408.49,
      "free_gb": 67.38,
      "percent": 85.8,
      "status": "warning"
    }
  ],
  "critical_disks": []
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation indicates that the 'C:\' drive on the server 'example_server' is using 85.8% of its space, which is a significant amount and could potentially lead to issues such as performance degradation or system crashes if not addressed.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation indicates that the 'C:\' drive on the server 'example_server' is using 85.8% of its space, which is a significant amount and could potentially lead to issues such as performance degradation or system crashes if not addressed.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': "The observation indicates that the 'C:\\' drive on the server 'example_server' is using 85.8% of its space, which is a significant amount and could potentially lead to issues such as performance degradation or system crashes if not addressed.", 'required_agents': ['file_analysis_agent', 'vm_monitoring_agent'], 'investigation_history': [{'iteration': 0, 'tool_used': 'check_disk_space', 'finding': "The observation indicates that the 'C:\\' drive on the server 'example_server' is using 85.8% of its space, which is a significant amount and could potentially lead to issues such as performance degrad"}], 'lead_agent': 'Infrastructure'}
