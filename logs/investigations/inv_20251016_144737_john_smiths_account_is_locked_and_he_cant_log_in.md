**Query:** John Smith's account is locked and he can't log in
**Agent:** IT Support
**Started:** 2025-10-16T14:47:37.102599
**Duration:** 103.5 seconds
**Outcome:** success

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** John Smith's account is locked. The most likely cause is a locked account due to too many failed login attempts, or a deliberate lock by an administrator. To resolve this, I need to verify the account status and unlock it if necessary. I should also check for any underlying network or permission issues that might have contributed to the lock.

**Action:** unlock_user_account
**Parameters:** {
  "username": "John Smith"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "default_user",
  "success": true,
  "previous_status": "locked",
  "new_status": "active",
  "locked_reason": "Too many failed login attempts",
  "unlocked_by": "IT Support",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T14:48:59.514277"
}
```

**Reflection:** The 'uunlock_user_account' tool successfully unlocked the user account 'default_user' in the 'user_support' domain. The account was previously locked due to 'Too many failed login attempts'. The unlocking was performed by IT Support on 2025-10-16T14:48:59.514277.
