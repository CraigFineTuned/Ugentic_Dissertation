# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_231010
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** Network Support

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Since this is the first step in the investigation and we have no prior findings, I need to start with basic network infrastructure checks. The problem involves sporadic disconnections that could be related to firewall, DNS, or VPN concentrator issues. I should begin by examining the firewall rules to see if any recent changes or blocking patterns coincide with the reported outage times.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "localhost",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 27
}
```

**Reflection:** The firewall is active and has a standard ruleset. It allows common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) and blocks specific high-risk ports (like 3389, 445, 1433) from external sources. There are 27 recent blocks, but the data does not show any rules or blocked traffic on common VPN ports (e.g., UDP 500, UDP 4500). The provided data does not contain information about scheduled rule changes or patterns that occur every 2-3 hours.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The firewall is active and has a standard ruleset. It allows common ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS) and blocks specific high-risk ports (like 3389, 445, 1433) from external sources. There are 27 recent blocks, but the data does not show any rules or blocked traffic on common VPN ports (e.g., UDP 500, UDP 4500). The provided data does not contain information about scheduled rule changes or patterns that occur every 2-3 hours.
