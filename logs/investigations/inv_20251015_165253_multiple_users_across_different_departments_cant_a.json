The context indicates that the focus is on network connectivity and SMB path resolution.  The initial troubleshooting steps should verify basic network connectivity to the network drive server (10.1.0.1) using ping, traceroute, and port 445 tests.  We also need to investigate potential network devices (firewalls, routers, switches) and recent network configuration changes that might be blocking SMB traffic. Finally, we should check for any known network issues or outages affecting the network drive server.",
