# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251014_141415
**Query:** Cannot access shared drive
**Agent:** Network Support
**Started:** 2025-10-14T14:14:15.996210
**Duration:** 171.48 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the problem, we need to first understand if there are any network issues that could be impacting access to the shared drive. This includes checking for known issues in the network infrastructure and verifying security settings such as firewalls.

**Action:** check_network_bandwidth
**Parameters:** {
  "interface": "eth0"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "interface": "eth0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T14:15:01.371567",
  "download_mbps": 51.95,
  "upload_mbps": 43.57,
  "latency_ms": 45.42,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.53,
  "jitter_ms": 1.6,
  "status": "normal"
}
```

**Reflection:** The network performance on interface eth0 is within acceptable limits, with download and upload speeds of 51.95 Mbps and 43.57 Mbps respectively, a latency of 45.42 ms, a packet loss rate of 0.53%, and a jitter of 1.6 ms. These values indicate normal network operation without any significant issues.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** Given the problem, we currently know there are no known network issues and that network performance is within acceptable limits. However, to ensure a comprehensive investigation, we need to check if any security settings might be blocking access.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "shared_drive_server"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "host": "shared_drive_server",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 30
}
```

**Reflection:** The firewall rules on the shared_drive_server allow access to common ports such as 22, 80, and 443 but deny external access to port 3389. The blocked_ports list includes additional specific ports that are being denied: 3389, 445, and 1433. There have been recent blocks, with a count of 30.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The firewall rules on the shared_drive_server allow access to common ports such as 22, 80, and 443 but deny external access to port 3389. The blocked_ports list includes additional specific ports that are being denied: 3389, 445, and 1433. There have been recent blocks, with a count of 30.
