The network team suspects DNS or firewall issues, but IT Support believes it's related to user VPN configurations. Since no previous investigation steps have been taken, I need to start by gathering baseline information about the affected users' VPN setups and connection statuses. The key questions focus on VPN client versions, configuration parameters, and client-side logs during disconnections. I'll begin by testing remote access for a representative user to understand the current VPN behavior and gather initial connection data.",
