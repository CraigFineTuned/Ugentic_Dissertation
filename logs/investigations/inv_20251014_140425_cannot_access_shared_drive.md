**ID:** inv_20251014_140425
**Query:** Cannot access shared drive
**Agent:** Network Support
**Started:** 2025-10-14T14:04:25.423190
**Duration:** 354.22 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user is unable to access a shared drive. The knowledge base includes information about storage infrastructure and network dependencies, but no direct symptoms of the issue are mentioned. Given that shared drives often rely on network connectivity and file sharing protocols, we should first check the network status between the client and the server hosting the shared drive.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "[App 3]",
  "count": 5
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "host": "[App 3]",
  "packets_sent": 5,
  "packets_received": 5,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 5.98,
  "max_latency_ms": 83.36,
  "avg_latency_ms": 54.0,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test results indicate that the network connection to [App 3] is stable, with no packet loss and minimal latency. The average latency of 54.0ms suggests a responsive connection.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** The user is unable to access a shared drive, and the knowledge base includes information about storage infrastructure. However, the network connection seems stable based on the ping test results. The next step should be to check if there are any firewall rules that might block access to the shared drive.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "[App 3]"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "host": "[App 3]",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 32
}
```

**Reflection:** The firewall is enabled and has specific rules defined. Ports 22, 80, and 443 are allowed from any source, while port 3389 is denied for external sources. The blocked ports include 3389, 445, and 1433, with recent blocks recorded.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The firewall is enabled and has specific rules defined. Ports 22, 80, and 443 are allowed from any source, while port 3389 is denied for external sources. The blocked ports include 3389, 445, and 1433, with recent blocks recorded.

## Final Response
