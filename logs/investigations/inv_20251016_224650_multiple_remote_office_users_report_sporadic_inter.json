Both DNS and firewall are suspected by the network team, while IT Support suspects VPN configurations. Since the issue affects multiple users and follows a predictable pattern, this suggests a systemic issue rather than individual user problems. I need to start with basic network connectivity testing to establish a baseline and rule out fundamental connectivity issues before diving into more complex DNS or firewall analysis.",
