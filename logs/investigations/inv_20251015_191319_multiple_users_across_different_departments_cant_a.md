# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251015_191319
**Query:** Multiple users across different departments can't access shared files on the network drive
**Agent:** IT Support
**Started:** 2025-10-15T19:13:19.738655
**Duration:** 376.83 seconds
**Outcome:** INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Multiple users across different departments are unable to access shared files on the network drive. The provided context indicates a focus on user-specific issues, account permissions, and basic troubleshooting.  The prior findings from Network Support suggest a firewall issue blocking port 3389 from external sources, which could be related to remote access attempts.  Therefore, I need to investigate user authentication, group memberships, and permissions to the network drive, while also considering the firewall issue.  I'll start by asking the users some questions to gather more information about their authentication experience and then check their group memberships and permissions to the network drive.

**Action:** ask_questions
**Parameters:** {
  "questions": [
    "Can you verify the user accounts of the affected users have the necessary permissions to access the network drive?",
    "Are the users able to authenticate successfully to the network drive server?",
    "Are there any known issues with user authentication or directory services that might be affecting access?",
    "Can you check the user's group memberships to ensure they are part of the appropriate groups that grant access to the network drive?"
  ]
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tool": "ask_questions",
  "domain": "user_support",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "general_inquiry",
    "questions_asked": 4,
    "responses": [
      {
        "question": "Can you verify the user accounts of the affected users have the necessary permissions to access the network drive?",
        "answer": "Multiple departments affected, primarily IT (backups) and Operations (project files). No single user responsible.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the users able to authenticate successfully to the network drive server?",
        "answer": "Multiple departments affected, primarily IT (backups) and Operations (project files). No single user responsible.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any known issues with user authentication or directory services that might be affecting access?",
        "answer": "Multiple departments affected, primarily IT (backups) and Operations (project files). No single user responsible.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you check the user's group memberships to ensure they are part of the appropriate groups that grant access to the network drive?",
        "answer": "Recent application updates include database backup system (weekly), email archiving system (monthly), and temporary project files accumulating in shared drives.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      }
    ],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-15T19:14:34.487456",
    "context_gathered": true
  }
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation confirms the initial hypothesis that gathering detailed information from affected users is crucial. However, the responses indicate a lack of specific information regarding the user's login process, error messages, or recent account/permission changes. Instead, the responses point to recent application updates and a broad impact across multiple departments, suggesting a potential system-wide issue rather than a specific user problem. The user is not able to provide specific details about their individual experience.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** Multiple users across different departments are experiencing issues accessing shared network files. The initial network support findings indicate a potential firewall issue blocking access from external sources, which could be relevant. To investigate further, I need to gather information about the affected users, including their account status, group memberships, and authentication status. Specifically, I need to verify if their accounts have the necessary permissions to access the network drive and if they can authenticate successfully. I also need to check their group memberships to ensure they are part of the appropriate groups that grant access.

**Action:** ask_questions
**Parameters:** {
  "questions": [
    "Can you verify the user accounts of the affected users have the necessary permissions to access the network drive?",
    "Are the users able to authentiicate successfully to the network drive server?",
    "Are there any known issues with user authentication or directory services that might be affecting access?",
    "Can you check the user's group memberships to ensure they are part of the appropriate groups that grant access to the network drive?"
  ]
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "tool": "ask_questions",
  "domain": "user_support",
  "data": {
    "user_id": "general_inquiry",
    "questions_asked": 4,
    "responses": [
      {

        "answer": "Multiple departments affected, primarily IT (backups) and Operations (project files). No single user responsible.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the users able to authentiicate successfully to the network drive server?",
        "answer": "Multiple departments affected, primarily IT (backups) and Operations (project files). No single user responsible.",
        "confidence": "medium",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any known issues with user authentication or directory services that might be affecting access?",

        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you check the user's group memberships to ensure they are part of the appropriate groups that grant access to the network drive?",
        "answer": "Recent application updates include database backup system (weekly), email archiving system (monthly), and temporary project files accumulating in shared drives.",
        "confidence": "medium",
        "source": "simulated_inquiry"
      }
    ],
    "timestamp": "2025-10-15T19:17:09.401318",
    "context_gathered": true
  }
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation indicates that multiple departments are experiencing network drive access issues, primarily IT and Operations. The user responses, while acknowledging recent application updates and project file accumulation, do not pinpoint a specific cause like authentication failures or permission denials. The lack of a single point of contact and the broad impact suggest a systemic issue rather than an isolated user problem. The recent application updates might be a contributing factor, potentially affecting group memberships or permissions.
