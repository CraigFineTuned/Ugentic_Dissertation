# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_231020
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves sporadic VPN disconnections affecting multiple remote office users. Since the network team suspects DNS or firewall but IT Support suspects VPN configs, I need to start by analyzing the VPN configurations of affected users. The focus questions point to comparing VPN client configurations, timing patterns, and network paths. I should begin by testing the remote access (VPN) for affected users to gather baseline connection status and configuration details.

**Action:** test_remote_access
**Parameters:** {
  "user": "affected_user_1 (placeholder - would need specific user names in practice)"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "default_user",
  "vpn_status": "connected",
  "can_access": true,
  "ip_address": "10.0.58.174",
  "connection_time": "2025-10-16T23:10:25.677940",
  "bandwidth": "58 Mbps",
  "error": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The VPN connection is currently healthy - connected with good bandwidth and no errors. This single snapshot shows normal operation but cannot explain the 2-3 hour disconnection pattern. The test lacks historical data, rekey intervals, keep-alive settings, or connection logs needed to identify intermittent issues.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The VPN connection is currently healthy - connected with good bandwidth and no errors. This single snapshot shows normal operation but cannot explain the 2-3 hour disconnection pattern. The test lacks historical data, rekey intervals, keep-alive settings, or connection logs needed to identify intermittent issues.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': 'The VPN connection is currently healthy - connected with good bandwidth and no errors. This single snapshot shows normal operation but cannot explain the 2-3 hour disconnection pattern.
