**ID:** inv_20251014_090722
**Query:** I cannot access the shared drive on the server

**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the problem, we need to first establish if there is basic connectivity between the client machine and the server. This will help us determine if the issue lies in the network configuration, performance, or security settings.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "server_ip_or_hostname",
  "count": 5
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "host": "server_ip_or_hostname",
  "packets_sent": 5,
  "packets_received": 4,
  "packet_loss_percent": 20.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 18.41,
  "max_latency_ms": 69.66,
  "avg_latency_ms": 37.41,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test was successful, but it shows a 20% packet loss and varying latency. This indicates that the network connection is not ideal, as expected minimal packet loss should be close to zero.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The ping test was successful, but it shows a 20% packet loss and varying latency. This indicates that the network connection is not ideal, as expected minimal packet loss should be close to zero.

## Final Response

{'status': 'NEEDS_COLLABORATION', 'reason': 'The ping test was successful, but it shows a 20% packet loss and varying latency. This indicates that the network connection is not ideal, as expected minimal packet loss should be close to zero.', 'required_agents': ['network_diagnostic', 'security_monitor'], 'investigation_history': [{'iteration': 0, 'tool_used': 'ping_test', 'finding': 'The ping test was successful, but it shows a 20% packet loss and varying latency.
