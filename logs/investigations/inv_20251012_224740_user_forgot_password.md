## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user has forgotten their password, and the available knowledge base does not contain direct information on how to handle this specific issue. However, some of the documents provide context about backup verification procedures which might indirectly help in resolving the issue.

**Action:** check_server_logs
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "AuthServer",
  "hours": 24
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "AuthServer",
  "timeframe_hours": 24,
  "total_errors": 6,
  "errors": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-12T22:49:50.763798",
      "error_type": "OutOfMemoryError",
      "severity": "WARNING",
      "message": "Error message 1"

      "error_type": "OutOfMemoryError",

      "error_type": "ConnectionRefused",
      "severity": "WARNING",
      "message": "Error message 6"
    }
  ],
  "top_error": "OutOfMemoryError"
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation does not indicate any recent login attempts or password reset requests from the user's account. Instead, it shows server log errors related to memory and disk space warnings, as well as a connection refused error.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation does not indicate any recent login attempts or password reset requests from the user's account. Instead, it shows server log errors related to memory and disk space warnings, as well as a connection refused error.
