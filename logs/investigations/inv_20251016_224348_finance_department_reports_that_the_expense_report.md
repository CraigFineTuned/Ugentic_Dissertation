# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_224348
**Query:** Finance department reports that the expense reporting application crashes immediately on startup for all users in that department. System logs show permission errors.
**Agent:** App Support
**Started:** 2025-10-16T22:43:48.335688
**Duration:** 14.83 seconds
**Outcome:** success

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem affects all users in the Finance department and system logs show permission errors. This suggests a systemic issue rather than individual user problems. Since the application crashes immediately on startup, I need to first verify if the application is actually available and responding to requests, which would help determine if this is an application-level availability issue or a permission/access problem.

**Action:** check_app_availability
**Parameters:** {
  "app_name": "expense reporting application"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "application": "expense reporting application",
  "available": false,
  "status": "offline",
  "response_time_ms": null,
  "uptime_percent": 95.77,
  "last_outage": "2025-10-01T14:30:00"
}
```

**Reflection:** The expense reporting application is currently offline (unavailable). This matches the expectation that application unavailability could be the cause of the crashes. The high uptime percentage and recent outage suggest this is an unusual event, not a chronic problem.
