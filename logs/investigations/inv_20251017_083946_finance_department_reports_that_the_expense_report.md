# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251017_083946
**Query:** Finance department reports that the expense reporting application crashes immediately on startup for all users in that department. System logs show permission errors.
**Agent:** App Support

**Duration:** 6.69 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem involves application crashes with permission errors for an entire department. Since this affects all users in the Finance department, this suggests a systemic issue rather than individual user problems. The permission errors in system logs could relate to application server permissions, database access permissions, or file system permissions. I need to start by checking the application's current availability and status to understand if this is a complete outage or intermittent issue.

**Action:** check_app_availability
**Parameters:** {
  "app_name": "expense reporting application"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "application": "expense reporting application",
  "available": true,
  "status": "online",
  "response_time_ms": 418.18,
  "uptime_percent": 96.77,
  "last_outage": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The observed data shows the application is currently online and available with a high uptime percentage (96.77%). This directly contradicts the expectation of a complete or severely degraded outage.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observed data shows the application is currently online and available with a high uptime percentage (96.77%). This directly contradicts the expectation of a complete or severely degraded outage.
