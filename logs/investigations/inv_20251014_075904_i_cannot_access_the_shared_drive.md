**Query:** I cannot access the shared drive

**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The user reports they cannot access a shared drive. The knowledge base does not directly address this issue but provides information on backup jobs and storage infrastructure, which might be indirectly related.

**Action:** check_user_permissions
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "",
  "resource": "shared_drive"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "",
  "resource": "shared_drive",
  "has_access": true,
  "permission_level": "read",
  "granted_by": "IT Manager",
  "expires": "2025-12-31"
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation confirms that the user has been granted read-level access to the shared drive by the IT Manager. The permission is set to expire on 31st December 2025.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** The user is reporting an issue with accessing a shared drive. The knowledge base contains information about backup jobs and storage infrastructure, but no direct troubleshooting steps for shared drive access issues.

**Action:** check_user_permissions
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "resource": "shared_drive"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "user_12345",
  "resource": "shared_drive",
  "has_access": false,
  "permission_level": null,
  "granted_by": null,
  "expires": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation shows that despite the initial expectation, the user does not have access to the shared drive and no permissions are granted. This indicates a discrepancy between the expected and observed outcomes.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation shows that despite the initial expectation, the user does not have access to the shared drive and no permissions are granted. This indicates a discrepancy between the expected and observed outcomes.
