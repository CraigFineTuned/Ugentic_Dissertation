**Query:** Cannot access shared drive

**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Given the context, we need to first understand if network connectivity and performance are issues, as well as any recent changes in firewall rules that might be affecting access. Without prior findings, we should start with basic checks of network connectivity and performance.

**Action:** ping_test
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "\\shared_drive",
  "count": 10
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "host": "\\shared_drive",
  "packets_sent": 10,
  "packets_received": 10,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.0,
  "min_latency_ms": 19.01,
  "max_latency_ms": 80.06,
  "avg_latency_ms": 50.83,
  "status": "reachable"
}
```

**Reflection:** The ping test results show that the network connectivity to the shared drive is good with no packet loss and low average latency. This confirms that there are no network issues affecting this connection.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** Given that the ping test did not reveal any network connectivity issues, we need to further investigate potential performance bottlenecks and ensure there are no firewall rules blocking access. We should use more detailed tools like `check_network_bandwidth` and `check_firewall_rules` to gather comprehensive data.

**Action:** check_network_bandwidth
**Parameters:** {
  "interface": "eth0"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "interface": "eth0",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T14:37:16.741412",
  "download_mbps": 54.13,
  "upload_mbps": 27.27,
  "latency_ms": 36.85,
  "packet_loss_percent": 0.19,
  "jitter_ms": 1.79,
  "status": "normal"
}
```

**Reflection:** The network interface eth0 is functioning within expected parameters, with no significant bandwidth limitations or latency issues affecting the shared drive.

### Iteration 3

**Thought:** From the context, we have confirmed that network connectivity and bandwidth are not issues. However, there is no prior information about firewall rules or recent network changes affecting access. The next logical step would be to check if any active firewall rules might be blocking the connection.

**Action:** check_firewall_rules
**Parameters:** {
  "host": "shared_drive_host"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "host": "shared_drive_host",
  "firewall_enabled": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "port": 22,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 443,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "allow",
      "source": "any"
    },
    {
      "port": 3389,
      "protocol": "tcp",
      "action": "deny",
      "source": "external"
    }
  ],
  "blocked_ports": [
    3389,
    445,
    1433
  ],
  "recent_blocks": 40
}
```

**Reflection:** The firewall is enabled and has specific rules defined. It allows incoming TCP traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443 from any source. However, it denies incoming TCP traffic on port 3389 from external sources and blocks traffic on ports 445 and 1433, which are commonly associated with file sharing protocols like SMB (ports 445) and SQL Server (port 1433). There have been recent block attempts recorded.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The firewall is enabled and has specific rules defined. It allows incoming TCP traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443 from any source. However, it denies incoming TCP traffic on port 3389 from external sources and blocks traffic on ports 445 and 1433, which are commonly associated with file sharing protocols like SMB (ports 445) and SQL Server (port 1433). There have been recent block attempts recorded.
