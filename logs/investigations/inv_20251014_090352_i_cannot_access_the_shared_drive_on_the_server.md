**ID:** inv_20251014_090352
**Query:** I cannot access the shared drive on the server
**Agent:** Infrastructure

**Duration:** 169.27 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Error in thought generation: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 6 column 52 (char 630)

**Action:** check_server_metrics
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "server": "localhost",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T09:06:13.562267",
  "cpu_percent": 3.2,
  "memory_percent": 85.3,
  "memory_available_gb": 2.26,
  "memory_total_gb": 15.39,
  "disk_percent": 85.6,
  "disk_free_gb": 68.74,
  "status": "critical"
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation indicates that the server 'localhost' is under significant memory and disk pressure. The CPU usage is relatively low, suggesting it might not be a CPU-intensive task causing the issues.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observation indicates that the server 'localhost' is under significant memory and disk pressure. The CPU usage is relatively low, suggesting it might not be a CPU-intensive task causing the issues.

## Final Response
