**ID:** inv_20251014_185738
**Query:** Disk space low
**Agent:** App Support
**Started:** 2025-10-14T18:57:38.875343
**Duration:** 109.13 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** Based on the problem and context, it is suspected that application-specific storage issues may be causing low disk space. The focus should first be on checking database performance and application logs to identify any potential issues.

**Action:** check_app_database_performance
**Parameters:** {
  "app_name": "App_Support_20251014_185738"
}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "application": "App_Support_20251014_185738",
  "avg_query_time_ms": 4944.07,
  "slow_queries": 28,
  "active_connections": 8,
  "max_connections": 100,
  "connection_percent": 84,
  "status": "poor"
}
```

**Reflection:** The application 'App_Support_20251014_185738' is experiencing poor performance, with an average query time of 4944.07 milliseconds and 28 slow queries. The active connections are at 8%, which is below the maximum limit but still suggest potential resource utilization issues.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The application 'App_Support_20251014_185738' is experiencing poor performance, with an average query time of 4944.07 milliseconds and 28 slow queries. The active connections are at 8%, which is below the maximum limit but still suggest potential resource utilization issues.
