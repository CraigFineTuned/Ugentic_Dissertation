# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_194550
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** IT Support

**Duration:** 98.66 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The investigation so far has focused on network layer diagnostics and common issues, but the user VPN configs have not been thoroughly explored. The knowledge base indicates that DNS and firewall are suspects from the network team perspective, while the IT Support hypothesis is centered around VPN configurations at the remote office users' end. To gain deeper insight into potential VPN misconfigurations or client-side problems causing intermittent disconnections every 2-3 hours for 30-60 seconds, a tool specifically designed to test and verify VPN connections would be valuable.

**Action:** test_remote_access
**Parameters:** {
  "user_id": "remote_office_user123"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "remote_office_user123",
  "vpn_status": "connected",
  "can_access": true,
  "ip_address": "10.0.23.69",
  "connection_time": "2025-10-16T19:46:32.394876",
  "bandwidth": "73 Mbps",
  "error": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The tool 'test_remote_access' has successfully established that the user remote_office_user123 is connected to the VPN and can access resources on the corporate network. The connection appears stable with no reported errors.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** Based on the context, user VPN configurations seem most likely at this point. The intermittent connectivity suggests an issue that persists across reboots and doesn't resolve with basic troubleshooting. Checking user permissions may reveal if a VPN configuration change was made recently.

**Action:** check_user_permissions
**Parameters:** {
  "user": "remote_office_user123"
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "user_id": "default_user",
  "resource": "default_resource",
  "has_access": false,
  "permission_level": null,
  "granted_by": null,
  "expires": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The observed output indicates that the user with ID 'default_user' does not have access to the default_resource. The permission_level, granted_by, and expires fields are null.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The observed output indicates that the user with ID 'default_user' does not have access to the default_resource. The permission_level, granted_by, and expires fields are null.
