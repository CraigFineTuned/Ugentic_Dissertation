# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251017_100943
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours.
**Agent:** Network Support
**Started:** 2025-10-17T10:09:43.937372
**Duration:** 8.09 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem description indicates sporadic disconnections every 2-3 hours, which strongly correlates with typical DHCP lease expiration times. Since this is the first investigation step and no prior findings exist, I should start by examining the most likely cause based on the timing pattern. DHCP lease issues would manifest exactly with this 2-3 hour cadence as clients attempt to renew their IP addresses.

**Action:** get_network_utilization
**Parameters:** {}

**Result:** âœ… Success
```json
{
  "interface": "default",
  "bytes_sent": 49335310,
  "bytes_recv": 1386970188,
  "packets_sent": 253517,
  "packets_recv": 620800
}
```

**Reflection:** The data provided is a single snapshot of network utilization for the default interface. It shows total bytes and packets sent/received since the interface last reset or the counters were cleared. This single data point cannot reveal any patterns, spikes, or periodic events (like those occurring every 2-3 hours) as it lacks a time-series history.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The data provided is a single snapshot of network utilization for the default interface. It shows total bytes and packets sent/received since the interface last reset or the counters were cleared. This single data point cannot reveal any patterns, spikes, or periodic events (like those occurring every 2-3 hours) as it lacks a time-series history.

## Final Response
