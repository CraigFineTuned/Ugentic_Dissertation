The provided context indicates a focus on user-specific issues, account permissions, and basic troubleshooting.  The prior findings from Network Support suggest a firewall issue blocking port 3389 from external sources, which could be related to remote access attempts.  Therefore, I need to investigate user authentication, group memberships, and permissions to the network drive, while also considering the firewall issue.  I'll start by asking the users some questions to gather more information about their authentication experience and then check their group memberships and permissions to the network drive.",
