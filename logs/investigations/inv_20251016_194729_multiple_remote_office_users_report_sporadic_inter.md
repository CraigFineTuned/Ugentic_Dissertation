# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251016_194729
**Query:** Multiple remote office users report sporadic internet disconnections. Connection drops for 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours. Network team suspects either DNS or firewall, but IT Support suspects user VPN configs. None of the usual solutions (reconnect, reboot) help.
**Agent:** Infrastructure
**Started:** 2025-10-16T19:47:29.190116
**Duration:** 56.28 seconds
**Outcome:** needs_collaboration

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The key context indicates that the issue is intermittent connectivity lasting 30-60 seconds every 2-3 hours, which doesn't align with typical DNS or firewall issues as suspected by the network team. IT Support suspects user VPN configs. To further investigate this angle, I need a tool that can provide detailed insights into VPN connection stability and performance.

**Action:** check_process_list

**Reflection:** The provided data shows that there are no processes consuming high CPU resources on the server. The top processes listed have minimal CPU and memory usage, with most of them having 0% CPU utilization.

## Collaboration Decision

**Triggered:** Yes
**Reason:** The provided data shows that there are no processes consuming high CPU resources on the server. The top processes listed have minimal CPU and memory usage, with most of them having 0% CPU utilization.

## Final Response
