      "thought": "The prior finding indicates a permissions issue ('default_user' lacks access), but my focus is on network-level connectivity. Since Sarah can connect to the printer but documents won't print, there may be a firewall or ACL blocking the specific print protocols (like port 9100) after the initial connection handshake. This would explain why connectivity tests might pass but data transfer fails. I need to check if firewall rules are blocking the necessary ports for printing.",
