# Investigation Report

**ID:** inv_20251015_190316
**Query:** Multiple users across different departments can't access shared files on the network drive
**Agent:** Infrastructure
**Started:** 2025-10-15T19:03:16.326452
**Duration:** 399.14 seconds
**Outcome:** INVESTIGATION_COMPLETE

## Investigation Process

### Iteration 1

**Thought:** The problem states that multiple users across different departments cannot access shared files on the network drive. The knowledge base indicates a firewall rule (Rule 500) that allows users from the internal network (10.2.0.0/22) to access the file server (10.1.0.31) via SMB. This suggests a potential firewall issue or a misconfiguration in the firewall rule. I should investigate the firewall configuration to ensure the rule is active and correctly configured. I will start by checking the firewall rules related to the user VLAN and the file server.

**Action:** check_server_logs
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "Firewall",
  "hours": 24
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "server": "Firewall",
  "timeframe_hours": 24,
  "total_errors": 0,
  "errors": [],
  "top_error": null
}
```

**Reflection:** The observation confirms that the `check_server_logs` tool successfully retrieved firewall logs from the firewall server for the past 24 hours.  Crucially, the logs show zero errors and no specific denials related to user access to the file server. This suggests that Rule 500 is either not being triggered, or if it is, it's functioning correctly and not resulting in errors or access denials.  The absence of errors is a positive indicator.

### Iteration 2

**Thought:** The problem states that multiple users across different departments cannot access shared files on the network drive. The knowledge base indicates a firewall rule (Rule 500) that allows users on the 10.2.0.0/22 VLAN to access the file server at 10.1.0.31 via SMB.  The issue likely stems from a firewall misconfiguration, a network connectivity problem, or a problem with the file server itself.  Since the problem mentions multiple users across different departments, it's likely not a single user issue.  Checking firewall logs is a good starting point to see if the firewall is blocking the traffic.

**Action:** check_server_logs
**Parameters:** {
  "server_name": "Firewall",
  "hours": 24
}

**Result:** ✅ Success
```json
{
  "server": "Firewall",
  "timeframe_hours": 24,
  "total_errors": 0,
  "errors": [],
  "top_error": null
}
```

**Reflection:** Error in reflection: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 10 column 1 (char 1115)
