### Principle 2: Knowledge Sharing
**Application:**
- Alex noted user was unaware of self-service portal
- Will share this pattern with Service Desk Manager for proactive user education
- Even routine tasks contribute to collective learning

### Principle 3: Mutual Support
**Application:**
- Service Desk Manager checked team workload before assignment
- Balanced distribution ensures no one is overwhelmed
- Alex available to help if other teammates need support after this quick resolution

### Principle 4: Consensus Building
**Application:**
- (Not applicable for routine individual tasks)
- Consensus already exists in documented standard procedures
