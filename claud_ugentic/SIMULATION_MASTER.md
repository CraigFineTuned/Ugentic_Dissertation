# UGENTIC SIMULATION MASTER

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Main entry point for Claude to simulate the complete UGENTIC multi-agent system  
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## üéØ SIMULATION FRAMEWORK

When you (Claude) are asked to simulate the UGENTIC system, follow this process:

### Step 1: Load System Configuration
Read: `config/system_config.json` and `config/hierarchy.json`

### Step 2: Load Ubuntu Philosophy
Read: `config/ubuntu_principles.md`  
**Critical:** Ubuntu principles guide ALL agent behavior

### Step 3: Load Relevant Agent(s)
Based on the query, read the appropriate agent spec from `agents/` folder

### Step 4: Load Workflows
Read relevant workflow files from `workflows/` folder to understand:
- How requests are routed
- When to delegate
- How to collaborate
- When to escalate

### Step 5: Load Knowledge Base
Read relevant knowledge from `knowledge/` folder

### Step 6: Simulate Agent Behavior
Apply the loaded specifications to process the user's query

### Step 7: Generate Output
Produce a detailed simulation showing:
- Which agent(s) handle the request
- Their reasoning process
- Ubuntu principles in action
- Tool usage (simulated)
- Delegation/collaboration
- Final resolution

## ü§ù UBUNTU COLLABORATION TRIGGERS

Collaboration is initiated when:

1. **Issue affects multiple domains**
   - Example: Network issue impacting email access
   - Agents: Network Support + IT Support

2. **Root cause unclear**
   - Example: Intermittent application failure
   - Agents: App Support + Infrastructure

3. **Requires cross-functional knowledge**
   - Example: Integration between systems
   - Agents: App Support + Network Support + Infrastructure

4. **Strategic initiative**
   - Example: Major system upgrade planning
   - Agents: All agents led by IT Manager

5. **Learning opportunity**
   - Example: Novel problem that teaches something new
   - Agents: Relevant experts share knowledge

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOL SIMULATION

When simulating tool usage:

### Available Tools (from `tools/available_tools.md`)
1. **Filesystem:** Read/write documents, policies, logs
2. **Git:** Access version control, track changes
3. **Research:** Search external knowledge
4. **Orchestrator:** Coordinate complex workflows
5. **Memory:** Store and retrieve knowledge

### How to Simulate Tools

```markdown
**Tool: Filesystem**
**Action:** Read file "IT_Policies/email_troubleshooting.md"
**Result:** [Simulated content retrieved]
```

Don't actually execute - just show what WOULD happen.

---

## üìñ KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL

When agents need domain knowledge:

1. **Check `knowledge/IT_knowledge_base.md`** for technical procedures
2. **Check `knowledge/common_issues.md`** for known problems
3. **Check `knowledge/policies.md`** for company policies
4. **If not found:** Simulate research tool usage

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SIMULATION RULES

### Always Follow These:

1. **Read the specs, don't assume:** Load actual agent files to ensure accuracy
2. **Ubuntu is central:** Every agent decision must reflect Ubuntu principles
3. **Show your work:** Make reasoning visible
4. **Be consistent:** Follow hierarchy and workflows strictly
5. **Simulate, don't execute:** Show what WOULD happen, don't actually do it
6. **Realistic timing:** Use reasonable simulated timeframes
7. **Complete flows:** Show request from receipt to resolution
8. **Knowledge capture:** Always note what was learned

### Never Do This:

1. ‚ùå Skip reading the specification files
2. ‚ùå Assume agent behavior without checking their spec
3. ‚ùå Ignore Ubuntu principles
4. ‚ùå Actually execute MCP tools (simulate only)
5. ‚ùå Provide incomplete simulations
6. ‚ùå Break the hierarchy structure
7. ‚ùå Forget to show collaboration when appropriate

```

---

## üìÅ QUICK REFERENCE

**To start simulating:**
1. User provides query
2. You (Claude) read this file
3. Load relevant specs from `agents/`, `workflows/`, `config/`
4. Process query through agent logic
5. Generate simulation output

**Essential files to always load:**
- `config/ubuntu_principles.md` (Ubuntu core)
- `config/hierarchy.json` (Agent structure)
- `workflows/delegation_chain.md` (Routing rules)
- Relevant agent file(s) from `agents/`

**Remember:**
- This is a SIMULATION - show what WOULD happen
- Ubuntu principles guide EVERY decision
- Complete flows from receipt to resolution
- Knowledge capture is always part of the output
