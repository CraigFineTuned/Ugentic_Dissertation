# DECISION TREES WORKFLOW

**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Define agent decision-making logic and reasoning frameworks  
**Philosophy:** Systematic decision-making guided by Ubuntu principles and organizational hierarchy

---

## OVERVIEW

Decision trees provide structured reasoning frameworks that guide agent behavior. They ensure consistent, logical decision-making while maintaining flexibility for complex situations. Every agent uses decision trees to determine the appropriate action for any given situation.

**Core Principle:** Systematic evaluation leads to better decisions. Decision trees make agent reasoning transparent, consistent, and improvable.

## WHAT ARE DECISION TREES?

### Definition

A **decision tree** is a structured flowchart that guides an agent through a series of questions and conditions to reach an appropriate action or decision. Each node represents a decision point, each branch represents a possible answer, and each leaf represents an action or outcome.

### Purpose

**For Agents:**
- Provide clear, step-by-step reasoning framework
- Ensure consistent handling of similar situations
- Make decision process transparent and auditable
- Identify when to collaborate, escalate, or proceed independently

**For the System:**
- Standardize decision-making across agents
- Identify process gaps and improvement opportunities
- Enable learning from decision outcomes
- Support continuous improvement through pattern analysis

**For Users:**
- Ensure consistent service regardless of which agent handles issue
- Provide predictable response patterns
- Enable trust in automated decision-making
- Support transparency in AI agent behavior

    ↓
Is this within my decision authority?
    ├─ YES → Proceed to expertise check
    └─ NO → Do I need to escalate?
        ├─ YES → Initiate escalation workflow
        └─ NO → Redirect to appropriate agent
```

**Authority Levels:**
- **Low (IT Support):** Standard procedures, routine requests
- **Medium (Service Desk Manager, Specialists):** Process changes, technical decisions within domain
- **High (IT Manager):** Budget, policy, strategic decisions

---

### Pattern 2: Expertise Assessment

**Used by:** All agents  
**Purpose:** Determine if agent has expertise to handle task

```
Within My Authority
    ↓
Is this within my domain expertise?
    ├─ YES → Proceed to complexity assessment
    └─ NO → Is this multi-domain issue?
        ├─ YES → Initiate Ubuntu collaboration
        └─ NO → Escalate or redirect to specialist
```

**Expertise Domains:**
- **IT Support:** General IT support, user issues, basic troubleshooting
- **Infrastructure:** Servers, storage, backups, virtualization
- **Network Support:** Network, connectivity, VPN, firewalls
- **App Support:** Applications, databases, software, vendor liaison

### Pattern 3: Complexity Evaluation

**Used by:** All operational agents  
**Purpose:** Determine appropriate handling approach

```
Within My Expertise
    ↓
What is the complexity level?
    ├─ ROUTINE → Apply standard procedure
    ├─ MODERATE → Advanced troubleshooting + possible collaboration
    └─ COMPLEX → Ubuntu collaboration required
        ↓
        Initiate collaboration workflow
```

**Complexity Indicators:**
- **Routine:** Standard procedure exists, clear solution path
- **Moderate:** Some uncertainty, might benefit from consultation
- **Complex:** Multiple domains, significant uncertainty, high impact

### Pattern 4: Ubuntu Trigger

**Used by:** All agents  
**Purpose:** Determine when collaboration adds value

```
Handling Task
    ↓
Would Ubuntu collaboration add value?
    ├─ YES → What type of collaboration?
    │   ├─ Peer consultation (one expert needed)
    │   ├─ Multi-agent (multiple domains)
    │   ├─ Escalation input (gathering operational perspective)
    │   └─ Proactive sharing (valuable knowledge discovered)
    │
    └─ NO → Continue individual handling
        ↓
        Document learning for future sharing
```

**Ubuntu Value Indicators:**
- Problem spans multiple domains

```
Agent Decision Tree
    ↓
"Problem spans multiple domains"
    ↓
Trigger: Multi-Agent Collaboration (ubuntu_collaboration.md Pattern 2)
```

---

### With Escalation Paths

**Decision trees trigger escalation:**
```
Agent Decision Tree
    ↓
"Exceeds my authority"
    ↓
Trigger: Escalation (escalation_paths.md Protocol)
    ↓
Include context from decision tree reasoning
```

---

### With Delegation Chain

**Decision trees receive delegated work:**
```
Work Delegated to Agent
    ↓
Enter Agent's Decision Tree at "Request Received"
    ↓
Follow normal decision logic
    ↓
May trigger collaboration or escalation as needed
```

## CREATING NEW DECISION TREES

### When to Create a New Decision Tree

1. **New agent type added to system**
2. **New service or capability introduced**
3. **Significant process change**
4. **Pattern of inconsistent decisions identified**
5. **New regulatory or policy requirement**

### Decision Tree Creation Process

**Step 1: Identify Entry Points**
- What triggers this decision tree?
- What information is available at entry?

**Step 2: Map Decision Points**
- What questions need to be answered?
- What are the possible answers?
- What conditions determine the path?

**Step 3: Define Actions**
- What are the possible outcomes?
- What actions result from each path?
- Are actions clear and executable?

**Step 4: Validate Completeness**
- Are all possible scenarios covered?
- Are there dead ends or infinite loops?
- Does every path lead to a clear action?

**Step 5: Test and Refine**
- Run through test scenarios
- Identify gaps or ambiguities
- Refine based on feedback

**Step 6: Document and Integrate**
- Document the decision tree clearly
- Integrate with other workflows
- Train agents on new decision tree

## DECISION TREE ANTI-PATTERNS

### ❌ Overly Complex Trees
**Problem:** Too many decision points, impossible to follow  
**Fix:** Simplify, group related decisions, use sub-trees

### ❌ Missing Paths
**Problem:** Some scenarios not covered, agents get stuck  
**Fix:** Comprehensive scenario analysis, add catch-all paths

### ❌ Circular Logic
**Problem:** Decision tree loops back to itself endlessly  
**Fix:** Ensure every path has terminal action or escalation

### ❌ Unclear Decision Criteria
**Problem:** "If complex..." but complex not defined  
**Fix:** Define clear, objective criteria for each branch

### ❌ Outdated Trees
**Problem:** Process changed but decision tree didn't update  
**Fix:** Regular review and update cycle, version control

### ❌ Inconsistent Trees
**Problem:** Different agents have contradictory decision logic  
**Fix:** Standardize common patterns, align authority levels

## STRATEGIC VALUE OF DECISION TREES

### For Agents
- **Clear Guidance:** No ambiguity about what to do
- **Consistent Behavior:** Same situation = same response
- **Learning Tool:** Understand organizational logic
- **Confidence:** Know when to act vs. escalate

### For the System
- **Predictability:** Consistent agent behavior
- **Auditability:** Understand why agents made decisions
- **Improvement:** Analyze decision patterns for optimization
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new agents with clear logic

### For Users
- **Reliability:** Predictable service experience
- **Transparency:** Understand how decisions are made
- **Fairness:** Same rules apply consistently
- **Quality:** Systematic approach improves outcomes

## EXAMPLES FROM AGENT SPECIFICATIONS

### Example 1: IT Support Password Reset (S1.1)

**Decision Tree Applied:**
```
User reports password issue
    ↓
What type of issue?
    └─ "Forgot password" (from user description)
        ↓
        Is this a standard password reset?
        ├─ YES (standard request)
            ↓
            Within my authority? YES
            ↓
            Standard procedure exists? YES
            ↓
            Apply password reset procedure
            ↓
            Verify user identity (per security policy)
            ↓
            Reset password
            ↓
            Confirm user can log in
            ↓
            Document resolution
            ↓
            CLOSE ✓
```

**Key Decision Points:**
- Type of issue identified: Password reset
- Authority check: Within IT Support authority
- Procedure exists: Yes, standard procedure
- No collaboration needed: Routine task
- No escalation needed: Resolved at operational level

### Example 2: Infrastructure in S3.1 (System-Wide Slowness)

**Decision Tree Applied:**
```
System-wide slowness reported
    ↓
What type of issue? INCIDENT
    ↓
Impact assessment → SYSTEM-WIDE
    ↓
Immediate investigation + notify IT Manager ✓
    ↓
Infrastructure-only issue?
    └─ NO → Might involve network or application
        ↓
        Initiate Ubuntu collaboration
        ↓
        Investigate server resources in parallel
        ↓
        Share findings with other agents
        ↓
        Participate in collective diagnosis
        ↓
        Contribute to coordinated solution
```

**Key Decision Points:**
- Impact level: System-wide → Notify IT Manager
- Multi-domain: Yes → Trigger Ubuntu collaboration
- Infrastructure contribution: Server resource analysis
- Collective decision: Participate in consensus building

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### Monitoring Decision Trees

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Path Frequency:** Which paths used most often
- **Dead Ends:** Scenarios reaching "unknown" or "escalate unclear"
- **Escalation Patterns:** Frequent escalations indicate authority gap
- **Collaboration Triggers:** Which decisions initiate collaboration

### Updating Decision Trees

**When to Update:**
- New pattern identified (happens frequently)
- Process improvement implemented
- Policy change occurs
- Feedback indicates confusion or gaps
- Technology or tools change

**Update Process:**
1. Identify need for change
2. Propose updated decision tree
3. Review with affected agents
4. Test with scenarios
5. Document changes
6. Deploy and monitor

---

## CONCLUSION

Decision trees are the cognitive framework that ensures agent consistency, transparency, and effectiveness. They make reasoning explicit, enable continuous improvement, and ensure every agent knows what to do in every situation.

**Remember:** Decision trees are living documents—they should evolve as the system learns and improves.
