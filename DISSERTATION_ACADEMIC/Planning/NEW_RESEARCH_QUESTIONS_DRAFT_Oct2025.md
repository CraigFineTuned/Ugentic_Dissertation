‚úÖ These questions are about **Ubuntu philosophy in AI** (subject), using UGENTIC as research probe (method)

### **"Research itself is the primary objective"**
‚úÖ Primary focus is philosophical inquiry, discovery, and theoretical contribution

### **"Ubuntu needs to be thoroughly investigated"**
‚úÖ RQ1 centers Ubuntu philosophy as core investigation
‚úÖ All questions explore Ubuntu's meaning, translation, and authenticity

### **"Questions are too technical with no clear purpose"**
‚úÖ These questions are theoretical/philosophical with clear scholarly purpose
