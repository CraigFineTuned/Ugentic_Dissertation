# METHODOLOGICAL CORRECTION SUMMARY
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Session:** 17
**Critical Issue:** Proposal stated UGENTIC "deployed at Sun International" (FALSE)
**Solution:** Corrected to Design Science Research methodology
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Proposal ready for submission

---

## üö® WHAT WAS WRONG

### **The Problem:**
The proposal and chapters stated that UGENTIC is **"deployed within Sun International GrandWest Casino's IT department"** which is **FALSE**.

**Reality:**
- UGENTIC = Research prototype/proof-of-concept (NOT in production)
- Sun International = Case study context (NOT deployment site)
- Interviews = Expert design validation (NOT user testing)
- Staff will NOT test or use the system
- Prototype is researcher's tool to strengthen research

### **Incorrect Language Throughout Documents:**
1. ‚ùå "deployed at Sun International"
2. ‚ùå "action research" methodology
3. ‚ùå "pre/post implementation comparison"
4. ‚ùå "staff using system"
5. ‚ùå "system performance metrics"
6. ‚ùå "user experience evaluation"

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT WAS FIXED

### **Core Methodological Change:**
**FROM:** Action Research with Production Deployment  
**TO:** Design Science Research with Expert Validation

### **New File Created:**
`Honours_Research_Proposal_CORRECTED_DesignScience_Oct11_2025.md`

- Expert assessment of design feasibility

**Interview Protocol Structure (NEW):**
- Section A: Current workflows and collaboration challenges (15 min)
- Section B: UGENTIC concept presentation and feasibility assessment (15 min)
- Section C: Cultural integration and design appropriateness (10 min)
- Section D: Design recommendations and implementation considerations (10 min)
- Section E: Transferability and organizational factors (5 min)

**Design Validation Framework (NEW):**
- Feasibility Assessment: Can this design work in practice?
- Value Assessment: Would this design add value?
- Appropriateness Assessment: Does design respect cultural authenticity?
- Transferability Assessment: Can design principles apply elsewhere?

### **4. Expected Outcomes**

**REMOVED:**
- "quantitative metrics showing improvements"
- "pre/post implementation comparison"
- "system performance evaluation"
- "user experience with system"

**ADDED:**
- "design validation evidence"
- "expert assessment of UGENTIC concept feasibility"
- "design recommendations for AI-workplace integration"
- "feasibility assessment and design principles"

### **5. Chapter 5 Outline**

**OLD:** "Chapter 5: Results and Findings"
- Pre/post comparison
- Performance metrics
- User experience data

**NEW:** "Chapter 5: Design Validation Findings"
- Expert assessments
- Feasibility analysis
- Design recommendations
- Cultural appropriateness validation

### **6. Research Questions (Subtle Adjustments)**

**Examples:**
- OLD: "What measurable improvements in cross-departmental collaboration..."
- NEW: "What design considerations and potential benefits for cross-departmental collaboration..."

- OLD: "How do IT staff experience culturally-driven AI..."
- NEW: "How do IT staff perceive the feasibility and value of culturally-driven AI design..."

### **7. References (Added 2 Sources)**

**NEW:**
- Hevner, A.R., et al. (2004) 'Design Science in Information Systems Research', *MIS Quarterly*, 28(1), pp. 75-105.
- Peffers, K., et al. (2007) 'A Design Science Research Methodology for Information Systems Research', *Journal of Management Information Systems*, 24(3), pp. 45-77.

## üéØ WHY DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH IS BETTER

### **Advantages:**
1. ‚úÖ **More honest** - Reflects what's actually happening
2. ‚úÖ **More ethical** - No production deployment risk
3. ‚úÖ **More feasible** - Realistic for Honours dissertation
4. ‚úÖ **Still empirical** - Interview data IS empirical evidence
5. ‚úÖ **Still validates** - Concept feasibility demonstrated
6. ‚úÖ **Still contributes** - Novel Ubuntu-driven AI design
7. ‚úÖ **Widely respected** - Established IS/IT methodology
8. ‚úÖ **Still publishable** - Used in top-tier journals
9. ‚úÖ **Provides value** - Design principles for practitioners
10. ‚úÖ **More realistic scope** - Fits dissertation timeline

### **What This Methodology Means:**

**Design Science Research Process:**
1. **Problem Identification** ‚úÖ (AI-workplace integration challenges)
2. **Solution Design** ‚úÖ (Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI concept)
3. **Artifact Development** ‚úÖ (Build working UGENTIC prototype)
4. **Demonstration** ‚úÖ (Show prototype works as proof-of-concept)
5. **Evaluation** ‚úÖ (Expert validation through IT staff interviews)
6. **Communication** ‚úÖ (Document in dissertation)

**What Interviews Actually Do:**
- Understand current workflow pain points
- Assess whether UGENTIC concept is feasible
- Validate cultural integration appropriateness
- Generate design recommendations
- Identify implementation considerations
- Provide expert validation of design

**Craig's Prototype Role:**
- ‚úÖ Working proof-of-concept (demonstrates feasibility)
- ‚úÖ Research instrument (use to analyze interview data)
- ‚úÖ Refinement tool (improve design based on findings)
- ‚úÖ NOT for staff testing (they assess concept only)
