## ‚úÖ WHAT I FIXED (Quick Summary)

### **The Problem You Identified:**
Proposal said UGENTIC is "deployed at Sun International" but that's NOT true‚Äîit's a research prototype.

### **The Solution I Implemented:**
Changed methodology from **"Action Research"** to **"Design Science Research"**

### **What This Means:**
- ‚úÖ Now accurately reflects what you're doing
- ‚úÖ Still academically rigorous and respected
- ‚úÖ Actually BETTER for prototype-based research
- ‚úÖ More honest and ethical
- ‚úÖ More feasible within timeframe

### **Major Changes Made:**

1. **Abstract** - Complete rewrite
   - "research prototype" (not "deployed")
   - "design science research" (not "action research")
   - "expert validation interviews" (not "user testing")

2. **Introduction** - UGENTIC section clarified
   - "developed as research prototype"
   - "using Sun International as case study context"

3. **Methodology (Section 7)** - Complete rewrite
   - Design Science Research framework (6 phases)
   - Expert validation through interviews
   - No "pre/post comparison"
   - Design validation focus

4. **Expected Outcomes** - Corrected
   - "design validation evidence" (not "performance metrics")
   - "expert assessment" (not "user experience")

5. **Chapter 5** - Renamed
   - "Design Validation Findings" (not "Results and Findings")

## üìö WHY DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH IS PERFECT

### **What You're Actually Doing:**
1. Build innovative artifact (UGENTIC prototype) ‚úÖ
2. Use real org as case study (Sun International) ‚úÖ
3. Interview experts (IT staff) ‚úÖ
4. Validate design feasibility ‚úÖ
5. Generate design principles ‚úÖ

### **What Design Science Research Is:**
Exactly what you described above! It's the RIGHT methodology for prototype-driven research.

### **Why It's Great:**
- ‚úÖ Respected in top IS/IT journals
- ‚úÖ Widely used for innovative system research
- ‚úÖ Perfect for Honours dissertation scope
- ‚úÖ Still makes novel contribution
- ‚úÖ Still publishable
- ‚úÖ Honest about what you're doing
