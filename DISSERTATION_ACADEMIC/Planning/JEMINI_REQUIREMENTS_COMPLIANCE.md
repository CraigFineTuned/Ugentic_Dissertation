## üéØ ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR FULL COMPLIANCE

### Immediate Actions (Today - October 1):

**1. Send Email to Jemini** (10 minutes) ‚è≥
- Attach: `Honours_Research_Proposal_C_Vraagom_Oct1_2025.docx`
- Subject: "Revised Research Proposal - Focused Single Case Study"
- Body: Use `EMAIL_TO_JEMINI_FINAL.md`

**2. Explain Timeline Reality** (Add to email) ‚è≥

**Suggested Addition to Email:**
```
Timeline Update:

As per your requirements, I have:
‚úÖ Completed comprehensive interview protocols (ready within one week)
‚úÖ Worked throughout September (system implementation complete, 6 operational AI agents)
‚úÖ Prepared research proposal (attached)

However, I must transparently communicate a timeline challenge:
- Ethics application submitted today (October 1)
- Ethics approval needed before interviews (typically 1-2 weeks)
- Interviews planned: October 14 - November 3 (10-14 participants)

Alternative timeline proposal:
- Chapters 1-3 (Introduction, Literature, Methodology): October 13, 2025
  (These don't require interview data and can be reviewed early)
- Full draft (all 7 chapters including Results/Discussion): November 18, 2025
  (After interview data analysis complete)
- Final submission: December 5, 2025

This ensures rigorous research quality while respecting ethics requirements.

Is this acceptable, or would you prefer a different approach?
