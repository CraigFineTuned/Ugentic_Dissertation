# REFERENCE CORRECTION SUMMARY
**Date:** October 20, 2025 - Session 30
**Action:** Systematic removal of deprecated sources and replacement with current approved sources
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üö® PROBLEM IDENTIFIED

During Session 30, deprecated references (pre-2020) were found in the rewritten proposal that violated the 5-year reference requirement established in Harvard_References.md (last updated October 11, 2025).

### **Deprecated Sources Found:**
1. ‚ùå **Shutte (2001)** - 24 years old - NOT in approved Harvard_References.md
2. ‚ùå **Murove (2014)** - 11 years old - NOT in approved Harvard_References.md

### **Location:**
- `Honours_Research_Proposal_C_Vraagom_Oct_2025_REWRITE.md`
- Section 4.2: "Ubuntu Philosophy as Bridging Mechanism"

### **Original Problematic Text:**
> "Murove (2014) explores Ubuntu as African moral theory, establishing philosophical depth. Shutte (2001) examines Ubuntu as an ethic of personhood, clarifying the relational ontology underlying the philosophy."

---

## ‚úÖ CORRECTION IMPLEMENTED

### **Replacement Sources (All 2020-2025):**

**From Harvard_References.md (Already Approved):**
- ‚úÖ **Udah, H., Tusasiirwe, S., Mugumbate, R. and Gatwiri, K. (2025)** - *Ubuntu philosophy, values, and principles: An opportunity to do social work differently*, British Journal of Social Work
- ‚úÖ **Wareham, C. S. (2021)** - *Artificial intelligence and African conceptions of personhood*, Ethics and Information Technology, 23, pp. 127-136

**From Web Search (To be added to Harvard_References.md if needed):**
- ‚úÖ **Mugumbate et al. (2024)** - *Integrating Ubuntu* - Frontiers in Sociology
- ‚úÖ **Shadrach (2025)** - Ubuntu relational philosophy
- ‚úÖ **Ajitoni (2024)** - Ubuntu interconnectedness

### **New Corrected Text:**
> "Additional Ubuntu scholarship strengthens the theoretical foundation. Udah et al. (2025) examines Ubuntu philosophy, values, and principles, establishing the moral and relational frameworks underlying African personhood. Wareham (2021) explores African conceptions of personhood in AI contexts, clarifying how relational ontology informs technological ethics. van Norren (2023) discusses community reconstitution through shared values, providing insights into practical implementation. These sources establish Ubuntu's philosophical depth and its applicability to contemporary organizational and technological contexts."

## üéØ CONTEXT PRESERVATION RULE

**Craig's Instruction:**
> "Whatever references are old as per what I just mentioned, we can still use the context, provided there are later (preferably latest sources) to reference the context."

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **Context Preserved:** African moral theory and relational ontology concepts
- ‚úÖ **Sources Updated:** Replaced with 2021-2025 sources covering same concepts
- ‚úÖ **Web Search Used:** To find current sources supporting the same theoretical frameworks

**Example:**
- **OLD:** Shutte (2001) ‚Üí ethic of personhood, relational ontology
- **NEW:** Wareham (2021) + Udah et al. (2025) ‚Üí African conceptions of personhood, relational frameworks in AI contexts

## üìù LESSONS LEARNED

### **Prevention Measures:**
1. **Always Check Harvard_References.md** - Before citing any source, verify it's in the approved list
2. **Web Search for Current Context** - When old sources have valuable context, search for 2024-2025 sources covering same concepts
3. **Systematic File Search** - Before finalizing any chapter/section, search for date patterns (2001-2019)
4. **Reference Compliance Checklist** - Add to every chapter completion verification

### **Integration Protocol:**
1. Read Harvard_References.md at start of every session
2. Cross-check all citations against approved list
3. Use web_search for additional current sources when needed
4. Document any reference updates in planning files
