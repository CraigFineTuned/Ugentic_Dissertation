# CORRECTED REVISION - RESEARCH QUESTIONS ONLY
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Purpose:** Conservative response to Jemina's specific feedback
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Only what she asked for

---

## 🎯 JEMINA'S EXACT FEEDBACK

> "Hi Craig, there is an improvement; however, you did not include any part about developing a system or AI agents. **Please revise your research questions to incorporate system development and evaluation.**"

**She specifically asked for:** "revise your **research questions**"

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS CHANGED (Conservative Approach)

### **1. Research Questions (Section 4)** ✅
- PRIMARY + all 6 secondary questions revised
- Now explicitly incorporate "development" and "evaluation"
- Categorized as: Development, Evaluation, Transferability

### **2. Research Objectives (Section 5)** ✅
- All 7 objectives revised to maintain 1:1 alignment with questions
- Required change (objectives must match questions)

### **3. Abstract (Section 2)** ✅
- Updated to reflect the revised research questions
- Added "Ubuntu + Agentic" naming explanation
- Convention: Abstract should summarize the questions

### **4. Date Note** ✅
- Updated to: "October 12, 2025 (UPDATED - Research Questions Revised)"

---

## ❌ WHAT WAS NOT CHANGED (Already Good)

### **Research Aim** - LEFT AS IS
Original already said:
> "to develop a validated methodology for designing AI systems"

### **Problem Statement** - LEFT AS IS
Original already mentioned the gap

### **Expected Outcomes** - LEFT AS IS
Original already mentioned deliverables including the prototype

## 📊 SUMMARY OF ACTUAL CHANGES

**Sections Changed:** 3 only
1. Research Questions (what Jemina asked for)
2. Research Objectives (required for alignment)
3. Abstract (should reflect questions)

**Sections Unchanged:** All others
- Introduction / Background
- Problem Statement (already fine)
- Research Aim (already fine)
- Literature Review
- Methodology
- Expected Outcomes (already fine)
- Limitations
- Chapter Outline
- References

## 🎯 KEY RESEARCH QUESTION CHANGES

### **Primary Question:**

**BEFORE:**
> Can indigenous African philosophy enhance the **design** of multi-agent artificial intelligence systems...

**AFTER:**
> How can indigenous African philosophy be integrated into the **development** of multi-agent artificial intelligence systems... and what is the effectiveness of the **developed UGENTIC system** when **evaluated** by IT staff experts?

### **Secondary Questions - Now Categorized:**

**System Development (RQ1, RQ2, RQ5):**
- RQ1: Development requirements for **building** systems
- RQ2: Operationalizing **during development** with **implemented** mechanisms
- RQ5: Implementation **within the development** process

**System Evaluation (RQ3, RQ4):**
- RQ3: **Evaluated benefits** of the **developed system** as **assessed** by experts
- RQ4: Experts **evaluate** the **developed system's** feasibility

**System Transferability (RQ6):**
- RQ6: **Development methodology** derived from **building UGENTIC**

---

## 📝 ABSTRACT UPDATE

**Added naming explanation:**
> UGENTIC **(Ubuntu + Agentic: Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence)**

This elegantly shows the intentional fusion of concepts in just 2 extra words.

**Updated to match new questions:**
- "develops and evaluates UGENTIC"
- "system development with expert evaluation"
- "evaluate the developed system's effectiveness"

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION

**Does this address Jemina's feedback?**

✅ Research questions now explicitly say "development"
✅ Research questions now explicitly say "evaluation"
✅ Research questions now explicitly mention "developed UGENTIC system"
✅ Research questions now explicitly mention "building" and "implemented"
✅ Objectives aligned 1:1 with revised questions
✅ Abstract reflects the revised questions

**Conservative approach:**
✅ Only changed what she specifically asked for
✅ Didn't unnecessarily modify sections that were already fine
✅ Maintained proposal integrity

## 📨 EMAIL DRAFT (UPDATED)

**To:** Jemini Matiya  
**Subject:** Research Proposal - Research Questions Revised

Dear Jemina,

Thank you for your feedback on the research questions. You're absolutely right—they needed to explicitly incorporate system development and evaluation.

I have revised the proposal as requested:

**Research Questions (Section 4):**
- Primary question now explicitly asks about **developing** the UGENTIC system and **evaluating** its effectiveness through expert assessment
- All six secondary questions revised and categorized as:
  * System Development (RQ1, RQ2, RQ5)
  * System Evaluation (RQ3, RQ4)
  * System Transferability (RQ6)

**Research Objectives (Section 5):**
- All seven objectives updated to maintain 1:1 alignment with the revised questions

**Abstract:**
- Updated to reflect the revised research questions
- Added naming clarification: UGENTIC (Ubuntu + Agentic)

The rest of the proposal (Literature Review, Methodology, References) remains unchanged as these sections were already strong.

Please review the revised questions and let me know if they now appropriately capture the system development and evaluation focus.

Best regards,  
Craig Vraagom  
Student Number: 40241517
