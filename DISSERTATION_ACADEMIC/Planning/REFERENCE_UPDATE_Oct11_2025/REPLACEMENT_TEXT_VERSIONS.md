# REPLACEMENT TEXT VERSIONS
**Created:** October 11, 2025
**Purpose:** Document OLD vs NEW text for proposal updates

---

## LOCATION 1: Introduction → Background and Context (Line ~38-39)

### **CURRENT TEXT (TO REMOVE):**
```
Recent research reveals significant AI-workplace misalignment: 77% of workers report increased workload from AI tools (Winsome Marketing, 2025), while 35% of employees lack clarity on how AI can support their tasks (Robinson, 2024).
```

### **NEW TEXT (REPLACEMENT):**
```
Recent research reveals significant AI-workplace misalignment: the Upwork Research Institute (2024) survey of 2,500 global workers found that 77% of employees using AI report it has increased their workload, with 47% uncertain how to achieve expected productivity gains. This is corroborated by Gallup's (2024) survey of 21,543 working adults, which revealed that only 15% of employees report their organization has communicated a clear AI integration plan or strategy.
```

### **RATIONALE:**
- Replaces secondary/tertiary sources with PRIMARY research
- Cites actual methodology (2,500 workers, 21,543 adults)
- Shows larger, more credible sample sizes
- Removes confusing "35% lack clarity" stat (unclear origin)
- Adds more specific "47% uncertain" and "15% clear plan" stats
- Both from 2024 (current research)

---

## LOCATION 2: Problem Statement (Line ~100)

### **CURRENT TEXT (TO REMOVE):**
```
Recent evidence shows 77% of workers experience increased workload from AI tools (Winsome Marketing, 2025), while 35% lack clarity on AI task application (Robinson, 2024), indicating fundamental disconnect between AI capabilities and actual work practices.
```

### **NEW TEXT (REPLACEMENT):**
```
Recent evidence demonstrates significant AI-workplace challenges: the Upwork Research Institute (2024) found that 77% of employees using AI report increased workload, with 47% uncertain how to achieve expected productivity gains, while Gallup (2024) found that only 15% of employees report their organization has communicated a clear AI strategy, indicating fundamental disconnect between AI capabilities and actual work practices.
```

### **RATIONALE:**
- Same PRIMARY sources for consistency
- Maintains flow of problem statement
- Adds credibility with specific statistics
- More precise language ("uncertain how to achieve" vs vague "lack clarity")
