## üìã CURRENT PROPOSAL REFERENCES (TO BE REPLACED)

### **Current Reference 1 (TO REMOVE):**
```
Robinson, B. (2024) '77% of employees confused about using AI at work', Forbes, 9 September. 
Available at: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2024/09/09/77-of-employees-lost-on-how-to-use-ai-in-their-careers-new-study-shows/ 
[Accessed: 11 October 2025].
```

**Problems:**
- Forbes is news/media outlet (not primary research)
- Web URL can change or go behind paywall
- Secondary reporting of unknown study
- No clear methodology
- "77% confused" stat is misleading/unclear

**Replace With:** Upwork Research Institute (2024) + Gallup (2024)

---

### **Current Reference 2 (TO REMOVE):**
```
Winsome Marketing (2025) '77% of workers say AI has increased their workload'. 
Available at: https://winsomemarketing.com/ai-in-marketing/77-of-workers-say-ai-has-increased-their-workload 
[Accessed: 11 October 2025].
```

**Problems:**
- Marketing company website (not academic)
- Web URL can easily change/break
- Secondary/tertiary reporting
- No methodology visible
- Citing Upwork study secondhand
- Marketing company has bias

**Replace With:** Upwork Research Institute (2024) PRIMARY source

## üéØ REPLACEMENT STRATEGY

### **Original Text (Current):**
Research shows employee struggles with AI implementation clarity and workload management. Robinson (2024) reports that 77% of employees feel confused about using AI effectively at work, while Winsome Marketing (2025) found that 77% of workers say AI has increased their workload.

### **Revised Text (NEW):**
Research demonstrates significant employee challenges with AI implementation, clarity, and workload management. The Upwork Research Institute (2024) survey of 2,500 global workers found that 77% of employees using AI report it has increased their workload, with 47% uncertain how to achieve expected productivity gains. This finding is corroborated by Gallup's (2024) survey of 21,543 working adults, which revealed that only 15% of employees report their organization has communicated a clear AI integration plan or strategy, contributing to a six-percentage-point decline in employee preparedness for AI between 2023 and 2024.
