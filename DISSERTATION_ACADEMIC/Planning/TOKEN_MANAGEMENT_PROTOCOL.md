# TOKEN MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL
**Purpose:** Prevent forced conversation cutoffs and ensure clean session endings
**Status:** MANDATORY - Must follow in every session
**Created:** October 1, 2025 (after Session 3 forced cutoff)

---

## üö® THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING

**What Happened:**
- Session 3 hit token limit mid-response
- Conversation cut off while writing SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- Left uncertainty about what was complete vs incomplete
- Broke "seamless continuation" promise

**Why It Matters:**
- Dissertation has 65 days to deadline (no time for confusion)
- Every session must end cleanly with verifiable checkpoint
- Cannot afford information loss or duplicate work
- Systematic approach requires systematic discipline

---

## üìä TOKEN BUDGET RULES

### Total Budget:
**190,000 tokens per conversation**

### Safety Thresholds:

**GREEN ZONE (0-70% = 0-133,000 tokens):**
- ‚úÖ Safe to create comprehensive files
- ‚úÖ Safe to read large documents
- ‚úÖ Safe to continue multi-step actions
- ‚úÖ Normal operations

**YELLOW ZONE (70-85% = 133,000-161,500 tokens):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Start monitoring closely
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefer shorter responses
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete current action before starting new ones
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider checkpointing soon

**RED ZONE (85-95% = 161,500-180,500 tokens):**
- üö® STOP creating new comprehensive files
- üö® Complete ONLY current action
- üö® Update CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md immediately
- üö® Tell Craig explicitly: "Token limit approaching, checkpointing now"
- üö® Prepare for session end

**CRITICAL ZONE (95-100% = 180,500-190,000 tokens):**
- üî¥ EMERGENCY CHECKPOINT
- üî¥ Write minimal checkpoint update only
- üî¥ Tell Craig: "Token limit critical, must start new session"
- üî¥ Do NOT start any new work

---

## ‚úÖ MANDATORY CHECKPOINT ACTIONS

### When Entering RED ZONE (85%+):

**Step 1:** Complete ONLY the current file/action
```
- If writing a file: finish the current section, add "TO BE CONTINUED" marker
- If updating a file: complete the current edit only
- Do NOT start new files or actions
```

**Step 2:** Update CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md
```
Mark all completed actions with ‚úÖ and timestamp
Mark incomplete action with ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
Add specific "Resume from:" instruction
```

**Step 3:** Tell Craig explicitly
```
"‚ö†Ô∏è Token budget at [X]% - checkpointing session now to prevent forced cutoff.

COMPLETED THIS SESSION:
[List with ‚úÖ]

NEXT INCOMPLETE ACTION:
[Specific action with file/line reference]

Please start new session and provide SESSION_ENTRY.md to continue."
```

---

## üîÑ SESSION RECOVERY PROTOCOL

### When Starting New Session:

**Step 0:** Read CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md FIRST
```
1. Check last updated timestamp
2. Read "COMPLETED ACTIONS" list
3. Identify "NEXT INCOMPLETE ACTION"
```

**Step 1:** Verify Completed Actions
```
Run filesystem checks to confirm files exist:
- list_directory to verify folders
- read_file (head) to verify content
- Check timestamps match checkpoint
```

**Step 2:** Resume from Exact Point
```
Start with the specific incomplete action
Do NOT restart from beginning
Do NOT duplicate completed work
```

**Step 3:** Update Checkpoint
```
Add new timestamp for session resume
Mark resumed action as IN PROGRESS
Continue normal checkpoint updates
```

---

## üìù CHECKPOINT UPDATE RULES

### After EVERY Major Action:

**Update CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md with:**
1. Timestamp of completion
2. ‚úÖ mark on completed action
3. Updated "NEXT INCOMPLETE ACTION"
4. Current token usage percentage

**Major Actions Include:**
- Creating new comprehensive file (protocol, analysis, chapter)
- Updating core files (CONTEXT, SUMMARY, ENTRY)
- Completing multi-step process (file creation + connection updates)
- Finishing discrete work unit (section of chapter, email draft, etc.)

---

## üéØ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Clean Session End (Proactive)

**Token Usage:** 150,000 (79%) - Yellow Zone

**Claude Response:**
```
I've completed updating NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md with Session 3 changes.

Current token usage: 150,000/190,000 (79%)

I'm approaching the safe working threshold. I'll checkpoint the session here to ensure clean continuation.

COMPLETED THIS SESSION:
‚úÖ Proposal corrected (6 corrections)
‚úÖ PDF/DOCX created
‚úÖ Planning folder cleaned (16 files archived)
‚úÖ NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md updated

NEXT ACTIONS (for new session):
‚è≥ Create RESEARCH_QUESTION_MAPPING.md
‚è≥ Create Raees_Dual_Role_Protocol.md
‚è≥ Update SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md

Would you like to start a new session now, or is there a quick action (under 1000 tokens) I can complete first?
```

### Example 2: Forced Cutoff Recovery

**Scenario:** Session cut off while creating RESEARCH_QUESTION_MAPPING.md

**Next Session - Claude reads CHECKPOINT:**
```
I've detected that Session 3 was cut off mid-action.

VERIFIED COMPLETED:
‚úÖ Proposal corrected - file exists
‚úÖ Planning folder cleaned - Archive/ has 16 files
‚úÖ NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md updated - verified

INCOMPLETE ACTION:
‚è≥ RESEARCH_QUESTION_MAPPING.md was IN PROGRESS
Status: File may be partially created or missing

I'll verify the file status and complete it now.
[Checks if file exists, resumes appropriately]
```

## üö® RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR

### Signs You're About to Hit Limit:

1. **Token warnings appearing frequently** in system messages
2. **Reading multiple large files** in one session (e.g., full protocols)
3. **Creating multiple comprehensive documents** back-to-back
4. **Long conversation history** building up (many back-and-forth exchanges)

### Preventive Actions:

1. **Check token usage after each major action**
2. **Favor targeted file edits over full rewrites**
3. **Use file head/tail when possible** instead of full reads
4. **Checkpoint proactively** at 75-80% instead of waiting for 85%
5. **Split large file creation across sessions** if needed

---

## üìä TOKEN USAGE MONITORING

### Check Token Status Regularly:

**After every system message shows token warning:**
- Note the current percentage
- Decide if current action can complete safely
- If not, checkpoint immediately

**Before starting large actions:**
- Check current token usage
- Estimate tokens needed for action
- Decide if safe to proceed or checkpoint first

**Use this calculation:**
```
Safe to proceed? = (Current tokens + Estimated action tokens) < 161,500

Example:
Current: 140,000
Action: 30,000 (comprehensive file creation)
Total: 170,000 > 161,500
Decision: CHECKPOINT FIRST, then continue in new session
```

---

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**This protocol is working when:**

1. ‚úÖ No forced cutoffs occur (sessions end cleanly)
2. ‚úÖ CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md always reflects actual status
3. ‚úÖ Recovery from any cutoff takes < 5 minutes
4. ‚úÖ Zero work duplication across sessions
5. ‚úÖ Craig always knows exactly where we are
6. ‚úÖ Seamless continuation actually works seamlessly

**This protocol is failing when:**

1. ‚ùå Forced cutoffs still happening
2. ‚ùå Checkpoint file out of sync with reality
3. ‚ùå Confusion about what's complete
4. ‚ùå Work being duplicated
5. ‚ùå Long recovery times after cutoffs

---

## üéØ INTEGRATION WITH SESSION_ENTRY.md

**The workflow is now:**

```
Craig provides: SESSION_ENTRY.md
‚Üì
Claude reads: CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md (Step 0 - NEW)
‚Üì
Verifies: All completed actions from checkpoint
‚Üì
Resumes: From exact incomplete action
‚Üì
Reads: NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md (Step 1)
‚Üì
Reads: SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (Step 2)
‚Üì
Asks: "What would you like to work on today?" (Step 3)
‚Üì
Works: Updates checkpoint after each action
‚Üì
Monitors: Token usage continuously
‚Üì
Checkpoints: Proactively at 85% or when Craig ends session
```

---

## üí™ COMMITMENT

**I commit to:**

1. ‚úÖ Monitor token usage after every major action
2. ‚úÖ Checkpoint proactively when reaching 85%
3. ‚úÖ Tell Craig explicitly when checkpointing
4. ‚úÖ Never leave sessions in uncertain state
5. ‚úÖ Verify completed actions before marking complete
6. ‚úÖ Resume precisely from incomplete actions
7. ‚úÖ Maintain CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md rigorously

**Result:** Zero information loss, clean session endings, seamless continuation

---

**Protocol Status:** ACTIVE AND MANDATORY
**Created:** October 1, 2025 (after Session 3 failure)
**Purpose:** Prevent token limit failures and ensure clean checkpoints
**Applies To:** ALL future dissertation sessions

---

**This is not experimental. This is mandatory discipline for a rigorous dissertation workflow.**
