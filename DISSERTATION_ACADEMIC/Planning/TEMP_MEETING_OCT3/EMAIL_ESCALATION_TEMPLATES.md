# ESCALATION EMAILS - TEMPLATES

## 48-HOUR ESCALATION (Use if no response by October 5)

**To:** [Programme Coordinator Name] <coordinator@richfield.ac.za>  
**CC:** Jemini Matiya <jemini@richfield.ac.za>  
**Subject:** Urgent - Supervisor Communication Issue Blocking Research Progress  
**Date:** October 5, 2025

---

Dear [Coordinator Name],

I am writing to escalate a critical issue affecting my Honours research progress.

## Situation

- **Scheduled meeting** with supervisor Jemini Matiya: October 3, 10:30 AM
- **No attendance** or response to meeting confirmation
- **Follow-up email sent** October 3 - no response as of October 5 (48 hours)
- **Blocking issue:** Need supervisor letter for ethics approval to begin interviews

## Impact on Timeline

- Cannot submit ethics application without supervisor approval
- Cannot recruit participants or conduct interviews
- December 5 deadline at serious risk
- Ethics approval takes 2-3 weeks - every day matters

## Work Completed (Demonstrating Readiness)

- ✅ Research proposal submitted October 1
- ✅ Chapter 1 completed - 4,120 words (October 2)
- ✅ Interview protocols developed - 76+ questions across 5 protocols
- ✅ System operational - 6 working agents (demonstrating feasibility)
- ✅ Ethics documentation prepared and ready
- ✅ Organizational access secured (Sun International GrandWest IT)

## Request

Please assist in securing supervisor communication OR assign alternative supervisor if Jemini unavailable.

I am prepared to work independently with minimal supervision but need formal approval to proceed with ethics application.

I work 6-day weeks while completing Honours - cannot afford delays due to supervisor unavailability.

## Attachments

- Research proposal (submitted October 1)
- Chapter 1 (4,120 words - completed)
- Email correspondence with supervisor (October 3)

Thank you for urgent attention to this matter.

Best regards,

## 72-HOUR ESCALATION (Use if no response by October 6)

**To:** [Department Head Name] <depthead@richfield.ac.za>  
**CC:** [Programme Coordinator], Jemini Matiya  
**Subject:** URGENT - 72 Hours Without Supervisor Response - Ethics Approval Blocked  
**Date:** October 6, 2025

---

Dear [Department Head Name],

This is now **72 hours with zero supervisor response** despite multiple contact attempts.

## Timeline

- **October 3, 10:30 AM:** Scheduled meeting - supervisor no-show
- **October 3, 11:00 AM:** Email sent requesting supervisor letter
- **October 5:** Escalation to Programme Coordinator - no response
- **October 6:** 72 hours - still no communication from supervisor

## Critical Impact

**Without supervisor letter, I cannot:**
- Submit ethics application (requires supervisor approval)
- Begin participant recruitment
- Conduct interviews in October-November window
- Meet December 5 submission deadline

**Timeline breakdown:**
- Ethics approval: 2-3 weeks
- Interviews: 4-6 weeks (10-14 participants)
- Analysis + writing: 3-4 weeks
- **Total: 9-11 weeks remaining to December 5**

Every day of delay reduces feasibility of meeting deadline.

## Work Completed (Ready to Proceed)

All research components complete except supervisor approval:

- ✅ Research proposal (submitted October 1)
- ✅ Chapter 1 complete (4,120 words)
- ✅ 5 interview protocols (76+ questions)
- ✅ Ethics documents prepared
- ✅ System operational (6 working agents)
- ✅ Organizational access confirmed
- ✅ 56 literature sources reviewed and cited

I have demonstrated execution capability and academic rigor.

## Immediate Request

**Option 1:** Assign alternative supervisor immediately  
**Option 2:** Provide direct ethics approval pathway bypassing supervisor letter  
**Option 3:** Confirm I may proceed with research and seek retroactive supervisor sign-off

I cannot afford further delays. I am prepared to work independently and need formal pathway to complete my Honours degree.

## Student Rights

As a paying student working 6-day weeks to complete this programme, I am entitled to:
- Responsive supervision (industry standard: 48-hour response time)
- Access to ethics approval process
- Fair opportunity to meet submission deadline
- Academic support services I am paying for

Three days without any supervisor communication is unacceptable and jeopardizes my degree completion.

Please advise on immediate resolution pathway.

Respectfully,

## NUCLEAR OPTION - 1 WEEK (Use only if October 10 with no response)

**To:** [Department Head Name] <depthead@richfield.ac.za>  
**CC:** [Programme Coordinator], Jemini Matiya, [Registrar if needed]  
**Subject:** Notice of Self-Directed Research Continuation - 1 Week Without Supervisor Response  
**Date:** October 10, 2025

---

Dear [Department Head Name],

After **one week with zero supervisor response** despite multiple attempts and escalations, I am notifying the university that I will proceed with my research to meet the December 5 deadline.

## Timeline of Attempts

- **October 3:** Scheduled meeting - no attendance
- **October 3:** Email sent - no response
- **October 5:** Escalation to Coordinator - no response
- **October 6:** Escalation to Department Head - no response
- **October 10:** 7 days - no communication from supervisor or administration

## My Intended Action

**I will proceed as follows:**

1. **Ethics Application:** Submit citing supervisor approval pending/in process
2. **Participant Recruitment:** Begin under organizational approval already secured
3. **Research Execution:** Conduct interviews, analysis, and writing independently
4. **Documentation:** Continue dissertation chapters (Chapter 1 already complete)
5. **Retroactive Approval:** Seek supervisor sign-off on completed work

## Justification

**I have demonstrated execution capability:**
- Research proposal complete and submitted
- Chapter 1 complete (4,120 words)
- System operational (6 working agents)
- Interview protocols developed (76+ questions)
- Ethics documentation prepared
- 56 peer-reviewed sources reviewed and cited

**I cannot allow supervisor unavailability to derail my Honours completion** when I have clearly demonstrated academic capability and research readiness.

## Request for University Position

**If this self-directed approach is unacceptable, please:**
- Assign alternative supervisor immediately, OR
- Provide direct ethics approval pathway, OR
- Confirm I may proceed independently with retroactive approval

**Otherwise, I will proceed as outlined above and seek retroactive supervisor approval on completed dissertation.**

I have invested significant time, effort, and tuition fees in this programme. I work 6-day weeks to balance study, work, and family. I have met every academic requirement and deadline.

I will not allow administrative failures to prevent my degree completion when the academic work is sound and execution is proven.

Please advise if university requires alternative approach. If I receive no response by October 12, I will interpret silence as implicit approval to proceed independently.

Respectfully,
