Jemini,

You didn't attend our 10:30 meeting today and haven't responded to my earlier email.

Admin (Nompumelelo) says they need "supervisor approved proposal" for ethics clearance.

**What I need from you immediately:**

1. Approve my proposal on Moodle (if that's the process), OR
2. Email an approval letter (template below)

I submitted the proposal October 1. I've completed Chapter 1 (4,120 words), interview protocols (76 questions), and have an operational system. All work is done on my end.

**If approval on Moodle:**
- Go to Moodle, approve my October 1 proposal submission
- Confirm once done

**If approval letter needed:**
```
I approve Craig Vraagom's (402415017) research proposal submitted October 1, 2025 for Honours research on Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI for IT departments. I support his ethics application.

Jemini Matiya, Richfield University, October 3, 2025
```

December 5 deadline requires I start interviews now. Ethics takes 2-3 weeks to approve after supervisor approval.

Respond today with whichever approval method is required.

Craig Vraagom  
402415017
