## ‚ö†Ô∏è SCENARIO 2: CONDITIONAL APPROVAL (LIKELY CASE)

### What This Means:
- Research approved BUT with modifications

### Your Immediate Actions:

**Priority 1: Understand Conditions (Within 2 hours)**
- [ ] List ALL conditions she mentioned
- [ ] Clarify what "success" looks like for each
- [ ] Identify which are quick fixes vs. major revisions
- [ ] Create action plan for each condition

- [ ] If it's "rewrite abstract" ‚Üí Do it today
- [ ] Send updated materials to her within 24-48 hours

  - Update all protocols
  - Adjust timeline
  - Recalculate interview hours
- [ ] If topic needs narrowing

**If she says: "Sample needs more diversity"**
‚Üí Action: Add participants from different departments/levels, justify new sample size, update protocols

**If she says: "Ubuntu needs stronger IT connection"**
‚Üí Action: Rewrite Ubuntu sections emphasizing technical implementation, add more code examples, strengthen IT percentage calculation

## ‚ùå SCENARIO 3: NEEDS MAJOR REVISION (CHALLENGING CASE)

### What This Means:
- Core concept approved BUT significant issues exist
- Might need: different methodology / restructure / rethink approach
- Not rejection, but substantial work required

### Your Immediate Actions:

**Priority 1: Don't Panic - Understand Fully (Day 1)**
- [ ] List ALL major concerns she raised
- [ ] Identify: Is this fixable? Or fundamental flaw?
- [ ] Determine: Can I address this in current timeline?
- [ ] Seek clarity: Email her with specific questions if unclear

**Priority 2: Assess Feasibility (Day 1-2)**
- [ ] Can requested changes be done in timeline?
- [ ] Do I need to adjust December 5 deadline?
- [ ] Do I need additional resources/access?
- [ ] Is the research still feasible with changes?

**Priority 3: Create Revision Plan (Day 2-3)**
- [ ] Break down each major revision into steps
- [ ] Estimate time for each step
- [ ] Identify what you can do vs. need help with
- [ ] Create new timeline with milestones

**Priority 4: Schedule Follow-up Meeting (Within 1 week)**

- [ ] Request feedback on completed sections
- [ ] Don't wait until everything is perfect

### Common Major Revisions & Responses:

**If she says: "Change from qualitative to quantitative focus"**
‚Üí Major issue: This changes entire methodology
‚Üí Response: Request meeting to discuss implications, timeline, feasibility
‚Üí Alternative: Propose stronger quantitative COMPONENT (mixed methods still) rather than complete pivot

**If she says: "This isn't 70% IT - it's more social science"**
‚Üí Major issue: Fundamental misalignment
‚Üí Response: Schedule meeting to walk through IT components breakdown, show code/architecture, emphasize technical depth
‚Üí Alternative: Reframe research focus to emphasize technical aspects more prominently

**If she says: "Single organization case study isn't sufficient"**
‚Üí Major issue: Would require multiple organizations = timeline explosion
‚Üí Response: Present case study methodology literature (Yin, Stake), explain depth vs. breadth trade-off
‚Üí Alternative: Propose adding comparative element (e.g., Luyolo at Head Office provides second perspective)

## üî¥ SCENARIO 4: REJECTION / MAJOR CONCERNS (WORST CASE - UNLIKELY)

### What This Means:
- Research not approved in current form
- Might need: completely different topic / different supervisor / reconsider program

### Your Immediate Actions:

**Priority 1: Understand Why (Day 1)**
- [ ] Get specific reasons for rejection
- [ ] Is it fixable or fundamental incompatibility?
- [ ] Does she see a path forward or suggesting pivot?
- [ ] Request clarity on what WOULD be acceptable

**Priority 2: Assess Options (Day 1-2)**
- [ ] Option A: Major pivot to different research focus
- [ ] Option B: Different supervisor with expertise in this area
- [ ] Option C: Appeal decision with additional justification
- [ ] Option D: Reconsider research program fit

**Priority 3: Don't Make Hasty Decisions (Day 2-7)**
- [ ] Take time to process feedback
- [ ] Consult with other academics if possible
- [ ] Review your own confidence in the research
- [ ] Consider: Is this truly unworkable or fixable with effort?

**Priority 4: Have Honest Conversation (Within 1 week)**
- [ ] Schedule frank discussion with Jemini
- [ ] Ask: "What research WOULD you approve from me?"
- [ ] Explore: Is there middle ground?
- [ ] Decide: Pivot vs. defend vs. find new path

**IMPORTANT:** This scenario is UNLIKELY given your preparation and IT focus. But if it happens, don't panic - you have options and strong work to build on.
