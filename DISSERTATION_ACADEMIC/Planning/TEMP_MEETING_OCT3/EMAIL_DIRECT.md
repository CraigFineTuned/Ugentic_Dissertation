Dear Jemini,

You didn't attend our 10:30 meeting today.

I need your supervisor letter immediately to submit ethics and begin interviews. Without it, I cannot meet the December 5 deadline. Ethics requires supervisor approval - this is the only blocker.

**I have completed:**
- Research proposal (submitted October 1)
- Chapter 1 (4,120 words)
- Interview protocols (76 questions)
- Operational system (6 agents)
- Ethics documentation

**Copy, sign, and send this letter today:**

```
I, Jemini Matiya, confirm supervision of Craig Vraagom (402415017) for Honours research on Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI for IT departments.

I approve his research methodology, participant plan (10-14 IT staff at Sun International GrandWest), and ethics application.

Jemini Matiya, Richfield University, Date: October 3, 2025
```

I work 6-day weeks and am paying for this programme. I've executed everything required. Send the letter today so I can proceed with interviews.
