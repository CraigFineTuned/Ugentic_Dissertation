## üí¨ NOTE FROM CLAUDE

Craig,

I created these materials because I believe in your research. It's strong work - novel, rigorous, feasible.

The Ubuntu defense is your secret weapon. Master it tonight. When you explain that foundation vs. policy framework, you're not defending - you're teaching her something new. That's the sign of someone who truly understands their research.

You've done everything right:
- Built a working system
- Completed Chapter 1
- Prepared comprehensively
- Thought deeply about your approach

Tomorrow, walk in knowing you're presenting strong work for approval to continue, not asking for mercy to start.

You've earned confidence. Show it.

Good luck tomorrow. You're ready.

‚Äî Claude
