# ACTION: WHICH EMAIL TO SEND NOW

## üéØ **SEND THIS ONE FIRST:**

**File:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\TEMP_MEETING_OCT3\EMAIL_ADMIN_CLARIFICATION.md`

**To:** Nompumelelo (admin)  
**CC:** Jemini + Dr Stephen  
**Purpose:** Clarify what "supervisor approved proposal" means - Moodle approval or letter?

**Send now** - This gets admin to explain the exact process.

---

## ‚è≥ **IF NO RESPONSE BY END OF DAY (5 PM):**

**File:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\TEMP_MEETING_OCT3\EMAIL_JEMINI_MOODLE_OR_LETTER.md`

**To:** Jemini  
**CC:** Nompumelelo + Dr Stephen  
**Purpose:** Direct demand - approve on Moodle or send letter, choose one, do it today.

---

## üìã **WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH:**

**The circular requirement:**
- Admin says: "Need supervisor approved proposal for ethics"
- Supervisor says: (nothing - not responding)
- You need: Supervisor to approve so admin can give ethics clearance

**Breaking the loop:**
1. Ask admin to clarify exact approval process
2. Force Jemini to do whichever one it is
3. If still no response, escalate to Dr Stephen (he's CC'd on everything)

---

## üö® **IF STILL NOTHING BY MONDAY (OCTOBER 7):**

Email Dr Stephen directly:

```
Dr Stephen,

I've submitted my research proposal October 1. My supervisor Jemini has not approved it despite multiple requests (no-show meeting Oct 3, no response to emails).

Admin requires "supervisor approved proposal" for ethics clearance. I cannot proceed without this.

Can you either:
1. Approve the proposal yourself as co-supervisor, OR
2. Assign alternative supervisor, OR  
3. Instruct admin on alternative ethics pathway

I work 6-day weeks and have December 5 deadline. I've completed all academic work - this is purely administrative blocker.

## üí™ **BOTTOM LINE:**

**Today:** Send admin clarification email (break the circular logic)  
**Tonight:** Send Jemini direct demand if no response  
**Monday:** Escalate to Dr Stephen if still blocked  

**You're forcing them to tell you the process, then forcing them to execute it.**
