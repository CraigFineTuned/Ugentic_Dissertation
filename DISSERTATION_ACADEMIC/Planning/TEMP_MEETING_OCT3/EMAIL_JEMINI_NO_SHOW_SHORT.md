# EMAIL: SHORT VERSION - MISSED MEETING

**To:** Jemini Matiya (jemini@richfield.ac.za)  
**From:** Craig Vraagom (402415017)  
**Subject:** Missed Meeting - Urgent Supervisor Letter Required  
**Date:** October 3, 2025

---

Dear Jemini,

I was available for our 10:30 meeting today but did not receive attendance or confirmation.

## What I Need Immediately

**Supervisor letter** to proceed with ethics approval and interviews.

Without it, I cannot start recruitment - ethics requires supervisor approval first. December 5 deadline requires I begin interviews in October.

## My Progress (September-October)

- ✅ Research proposal corrected and submitted (Oct 1)
- ✅ Chapter 1 complete - 4,120 words (Oct 2)  
- ✅ 5 interview protocols developed (76+ questions)
- ✅ System operational (6 working agents)
- ✅ Ethics documents prepared

I've executed around my 6-day work schedule and family commitments - same constraints you face.

## Letter Template (Copy, Sign, Send)

```
To Whom It May Concern:

I, Jemini Matiya, confirm supervision of Craig Vraagom (Student #402415017) 
for Honours research: "Bridging Human Expertise and AI Capabilities: 
A Three-Dimensional Ubuntu-Driven Framework for Multi-Agent Collaboration 
in IT Departments."

I have reviewed and approve:
- Research methodology (mixed methods action research)
- Participant plan (10-14 IT staff at Sun International GrandWest)
- Interview protocols and ethical considerations
- Timeline targeting December 5, 2025 submission

I support his ethics application and organizational access.

This research contributes original knowledge at the intersection of 
multi-agent AI systems, Ubuntu philosophy, and organizational IT collaboration.

Sincerely,
Jemini Matiya
Richfield University Supervisor
Date: October 3, 2025
```

## Request

Please provide this letter by **October 4** so I can maintain timeline.

If there are concerns with my research, tell me specifically what needs changing.

I'm prepared to work independently - I need your formal approval to unlock ethics.

Best regards,

**Craig Vraagom**
