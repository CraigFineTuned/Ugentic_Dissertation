# ESCALATION EMAIL (If No Response in 48 Hours)

**To:** [Programme Coordinator Email]  
**CC:** Jemini Matiya  
**Subject:** Supervisor Not Responding - Letter Required for Ethics  
**Date:** October 5, 2025

---

I need a supervisor letter to submit ethics and begin interviews. December 5 deadline requires I start now.

Jemini didn't attend our October 3 meeting and hasn't responded to my email requesting the letter.

**Work completed:** Research proposal, Chapter 1 (4,120 words), interview protocols, operational system, ethics docs ready.

**Request:** Assign alternative supervisor or provide direct ethics approval pathway. I cannot wait further - deadline is real.

**NUCLEAR OPTION (If 1 Week No Response) - October 10:**

**To:** [Department Head]  
**Subject:** Proceeding with Research - No Supervisor Response  

After 1 week with no supervisor response, I'm proceeding with interviews under organizational approval already secured. I will seek retroactive supervisor sign-off on completed work.

I've demonstrated capability (Chapter 1 complete, system operational, proposal submitted). I will not let supervisor unavailability prevent degree completion when work is done.

If this is unacceptable, assign alternative supervisor immediately. Otherwise, I proceed independently.
