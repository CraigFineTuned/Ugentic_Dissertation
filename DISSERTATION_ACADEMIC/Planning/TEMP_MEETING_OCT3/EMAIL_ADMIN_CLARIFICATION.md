**Date:** October 3, 2025

Good day Nompumelelo,

Thank you for your response.

**To clarify the situation:**

1. I submitted my research proposal on **October 1, 2025** (Honours_Research_Proposal_C_Vraagom_Oct1_2025.pdf)

2. My supervisor Jemini Matiya has NOT provided written approval yet - she did not attend our scheduled meeting this morning (10:30 AM) and has not responded to my request for approval.

3. This creates a circular problem:
   - You require "supervisor approved proposal" for ethics clearance
   - I need supervisor to approve the proposal
   - Supervisor is not responding

**My question:**

Is the proposal I submitted October 1 sufficient, and Jemini just needs to approve it on Moodle? Or does she need to provide a separate approval letter?

**Request:**

Please confirm exact process:
- What does Jemini need to do on Moodle to approve my proposal?
- Or does she need to email a separate approval letter?
- Once she does this, how long until ethics clearance is issued?

I have completed all work on my end. I am waiting only for supervisor approval to unlock ethics. December 5 deadline requires I begin interviews immediately once ethics is approved.

Best regards,
