# EMAIL: MISSED MEETING & URGENT SUPERVISOR LETTER REQUEST

**To:** Jemini Matiya (jemini@richfield.ac.za)  
**From:** Craig Vraagom (402415017)  
**Subject:** Missed Meeting October 3 & Urgent Request for Supervisor Letter  
**Date:** October 3, 2025

---

Dear Jemini,

I was available for our scheduled meeting today at 10:30 AM but did not receive confirmation or attendance.

## My Current Situation

I understand you have professional commitments, as do I. I work **six-day weeks on shift schedules**, balance family responsibilities, and am investing both time and tuition fees in this Honours programme. Like you, my time has constraints and value.

## Work Completed (Demonstrating Progress)

Despite these constraints, I have:

- ✅ **Corrected and submitted** research proposal (October 1)
- ✅ **Completed Chapter 1** - 4,120 words (October 2)
- ✅ **Developed 5 interview protocols** with 76+ questions
- ✅ **Built operational system** - 6 working IT agents
- ✅ **Prepared ethics documentation** ready for submission
- ✅ **Secured organizational access** to Sun International GrandWest IT department

This represents substantial progress in September-October, completed around my work schedule.

## Urgent Request: Supervisor Letter

**I need your supervisor letter immediately to proceed with interviews.**

Richfield ethics requirements mandate supervisor approval before participant recruitment. Without this letter, I cannot:
- Submit ethics application
- Begin recruitment 
- Conduct interviews in October-November
- Meet the December 5 deadline

**Timeline Reality:**
- Ethics approval: 2-3 weeks after submission
- Interviews: 10-14 participants = 4-6 weeks
- Analysis + writing: 3-4 weeks
- **Total: ~10 weeks to December 5 deadline**

Every day without the letter pushes my submission at risk.

## What I Need From You

**1. Supervisor Letter** (Template below - copy, sign, send)
**2. Confirmation** that my research topic is approved (85-90% IT focus, Ubuntu framework)
**3. Timeline acknowledgment** that November 18 draft (not October 7) is realistic given ethics blocks

I can proceed with everything else independently - I simply need your formal approval to unlock the ethics process.

## Proposed Communication Going Forward

Given our schedule constraints:

**Option 1:** Email responses within 48 hours for urgent matters  
**Option 2:** Scheduled 15-minute video calls (weekly/bi-weekly) at mutually agreed times  
**Option 3:** Asynchronous updates via email with questions/approvals as needed

I'm flexible on format but need reliable communication to maintain progress.

## Supervisor Letter Template (Ready to Sign)

```
To Whom It May Concern:

I, Jemini Matiya, confirm that I am supervising Craig Vraagom (Student #402415017) 
for his Honours research project titled "Bridging Human Expertise and AI Capabilities: 
A Three-Dimensional Ubuntu-Driven Framework for Multi-Agent Collaboration in IT Departments."

I have reviewed his research proposal and approve of:
- The research methodology (mixed methods action research)
- The participant recruitment plan (10-14 IT staff at Sun International GrandWest)
- The interview protocols and ethical considerations
- The research timeline targeting December 5, 2025 submission

I support his application for ethics approval and organizational access.

This research contributes original knowledge at the intersection of multi-agent AI systems, 
Ubuntu philosophy, and organizational IT collaboration.

Sincerely,
Jemini Matiya
Richfield University Supervisor
Date: October 3, 2025
```

**You can copy, sign digitally, and email back to me today.**

## Bottom Line

I respect your time and commitments. I ask for the same respect in return.

I'm paying for supervision and need functional communication to succeed. I've demonstrated execution capability - Chapter 1 complete, system operational, ethics ready.

**Please provide the supervisor letter by October 4** so I can submit ethics and maintain the December 5 deadline.

If there are concerns with my research approach, let me know specifically so I can address them. If the topic needs modification, tell me what changes are required.

I'm prepared to work independently with minimal supervision - I just need your formal approval to proceed.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Best regards,

**Craig Vraagom**

## P.S. Alternative Timeline Offer

If you have concerns about November 18 for full draft:

**Compromise:** Chapters 1-3 by October 13 (Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology) for your review, with full draft November 18 after interviews/analysis complete.

This gives you early chapters to review while I conduct research, ensuring December 5 submission quality rather than rushed October draft that will require major revision.

Let me know which timeline works for you.
