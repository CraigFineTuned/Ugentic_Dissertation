# EMAIL: RESPONSE TO ADMIN (FINAL VERSION)

**Subject:** RE: BSCH: Research Topic Submission Form  
**Date:** October 3, 2025

---

Hi Pumi,

Yes, I submitted my research proposal on Moodle on **October 1, 2025** (Honours_Research_Proposal_C_Vraagom_Oct1_2025.pdf).

**The issue:** My supervisor has not approved it yet. She did not attend our scheduled meeting this morning (10:30 AM) and has not responded to my emails requesting approval.

**My questions:**

1. Can you confirm my proposal submission appears on Moodle (October 1)?
2. What exactly does Jemini need to do to "approve" it - click approval on Moodle, or send a separate letter?
3. Once she approves, how long until ethics clearance is issued?

**Request:** I need ethics clearance to begin interviews for my December 5 deadline. If supervisor approval continues to delay, is there an alternative pathway (Dr Stephen approval, or direct ethics review)?

I've completed all work on my end - proposal, Chapter 1 (4,120 words), interview protocols. I'm only waiting for supervisor approval to unlock ethics.

Best regards,
