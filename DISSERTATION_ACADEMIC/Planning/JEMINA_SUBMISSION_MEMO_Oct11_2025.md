**TO:** Jemini Matiya (Supervisor)  
**FROM:** Craig Vraagom (Student 40241517)  
**DATE:** October 11, 2025  
**RE:** Revised Research Proposal - October 10 Meeting Follow-up

---

Dear Jemini,

Following our productive meeting on October 10, 2025, I have revised the research proposal to address all requirements and concerns discussed. This memo summarizes the key changes implemented.

---

## CRITICAL CHANGES MADE

### 1. Question-Objective Alignment ✅

**What You Required:**
- Research Questions must directly align with Research Objectives
- Clear 1:1 correspondence
- Each Objective must state which Question it addresses

**What I've Implemented:**
- Created **6 Research Questions (RQ1-RQ6)**
- Created **6 Research Objectives (RO1-RO6)** in perfect 1:1 correspondence
- Each Objective explicitly states "**Addresses RQ#**" in its title

**Example:**
- **RQ3:** What measurable improvements in cross-departmental collaboration result from Ubuntu-enhanced multi-agent systems?
- **RO3:** To evaluate the effectiveness of Ubuntu-driven AI systems by measuring improvements in cross-departmental collaboration metrics (**Addresses RQ3**)

### 2. Research Aim Made Explicit ✅

**What You Required:**
- Single clear Research Aim statement

**What I've Implemented:**
- Added dedicated **Section 3: Research Aim**
- Clear statement of overarching goal
- Includes "Why This Matters" subsection

### 3. Statistics Corrected ✅

**What You Identified:**
- "35% productivity LOST" claim was misleading
- Lacked proper citations

**What I've Fixed:**
- **Removed** misleading claim entirely
- **Replaced** with accurate statistics:
  - "**77% of workers report increased workload from AI tools**" (Upwork Research Institute, 2024)
  - "**35% of employees lack clarity on how AI can support their tasks**" (Robinson, 2024)
- **Added** proper citations to References

### 4. Ubuntu Rationale Strengthened ✅

**What We Discussed:**
- Ubuntu philosophy doesn't change like company policies
- Stable foundation for ever-changing AI world
- Preserves human aspect

**What I've Added:**
- Dedicated **"Why Ubuntu?"** subsection (Section 4.2)
- Four explicit reasons:
  1. **Philosophical Permanence** - Philosophy endures
  2. **Cultural Foundation** - Human-centered framework
  3. **Human Aspect Preservation** - Technology doesn't lose humanity
  4. **Structural Coherence** - Multi-agent systems ARE Ubuntu contexts

### 5. UGENTIC Positioned as Research Instrument ✅

**What You Clarified:**
- UGENTIC is research tool, NOT research subject
- Research is about Ubuntu-AI integration

**What I've Ensured:**
- Throughout proposal, UGENTIC called "**research instrument**"
- Never called "research subject"
- Research Questions focus on Ubuntu-AI integration, not system demonstration

### 6. Template Compliance Achieved ✅

**What You Provided:**
- Honours Research Proposal Template as sample

**What I've Implemented:**
All 19 required sections now present in correct order, including:
- Section 2: **Abstract** (NEW)
- Section 3: **Research Aim** (NEW - explicit)
- Section 13: **Expected Outcomes** (NOW DEDICATED SECTION)
- All other sections revised as needed
