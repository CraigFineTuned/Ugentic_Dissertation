## üí° KEY INSIGHTS

### **What We Learned:**
1. **Always trace secondary sources back to PRIMARY research**
   - Forbes and Winsome Marketing were reporting on Upwork's study
   - Going to the original source provides better credibility
   
2. **Sample size matters**
   - 24,000+ participants vs unknown = massive credibility boost
   
3. **Institutional sources are more stable**
   - Research institutes maintain permanent URLs
   - News sites and marketing companies reorganize frequently
   
4. **Methodology documentation is crucial**
   - PRIMARY sources show how data was collected
   - Secondary sources often lack these details
   
5. **Jemina's warnings are specific and actionable**
   - She flagged exactly what needed fixing
   - Following her guidance precisely = success

### **Process Improvements:**
- **Pre-submission checklist should include:**
  - Verify all web sources are PRIMARY (not news/marketing)
  - Check all URLs are stable (institutional/academic)
  - Ensure all statistics have documented methodology
  - Trace all secondary sources to originals
