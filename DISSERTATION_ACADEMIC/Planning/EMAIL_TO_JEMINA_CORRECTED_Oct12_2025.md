## EMAIL DRAFT (RECOMMENDED)

**To:** Jemini Matiya (jemini.matiya@richfield.ac.za)  
**Subject:** Research Proposal - Research Questions Revised

---

Dear Jemina,

Thank you for your feedback on the research questions. You're absolutely rightâ€”they needed to explicitly incorporate system development and evaluation.

I have revised the proposal as you requested:

### **Research Questions (Section 4) - Revised:**

**Primary Question:** Now explicitly asks how indigenous African philosophy is integrated into the **development** of the UGENTIC system, and what the effectiveness of the **developed system** is when **evaluated** by IT staff experts.

**Secondary Questions:** All six revised and categorized as:
- **System Development** (RQ1, RQ2, RQ5): How to build the system with cultural integration
- **System Evaluation** (RQ3, RQ4): How to assess its effectiveness and feasibility  
- **System Transferability** (RQ6): How to document the development methodology

### **Research Objectives (Section 5) - Updated:**
All seven objectives revised to maintain 1:1 alignment with the new research questions.

### **Abstract - Updated:**
Revised to reflect the updated research questions and added naming clarification: UGENTIC (Ubuntu + Agentic: Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence).

The rest of the proposal (Literature Review, Methodology, Expected Outcomes, References) remains unchanged as these sections were already strong.

Please review the revised research questions and let me know if they now appropriately capture the system development and evaluation focus, or if any further revisions are needed.

Thank you for your guidance in strengthening this research.

Best regards,
