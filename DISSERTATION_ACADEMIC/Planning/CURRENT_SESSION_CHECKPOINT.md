## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

### **1. Questionnaire Distribution Best Practices**
- ✅ Start with Sewrathan (get organizational buy-in)
- ✅ Personal introduction before formal email (especially for close colleagues)
- ✅ Send reminders but don't pressure
- ✅ Track who returns (assign P01, P02, etc. for anonymization)

### **2. Methodology Note for Dissertation**
In Chapter 3, clarify:
> "Data was collected through written questionnaires distributed to participants via email. This method allowed participants to respond at their convenience and provide thoughtful written reflections on their experiences."

### **3. Response Rate Management**
- **Target minimum:** 10 participants (core strategic, tactical, operational)
- **Ideal target:** 14 participants (add interns/former staff)
- **Realistic expectation:** 70-80% return rate
- **Backup plan:** If <10 responses, extend deadline or add optional participants

### **4. UGENTIC Positioning in Responses**
Expect participants to:
- Critique the design concept (this is GOOD)
- Question feasibility (expected for research artifact)
- Suggest improvements (GOLD for Chapter 6 Discussion)
- Raise concerns (demonstrates honest engagement)

**Remember:** You're investigating WHETHER Ubuntu-AI bridging works, not proving that it does.

## 🎓 CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY UPDATE REQUIRED

**Section 3.4: Data Collection Method**

Add this clarification:
> "Originally designed as face-to-face interviews, the data collection method was refined to written questionnaires to accommodate participant schedules and reduce logistical barriers. This approach maintained the depth of inquiry while allowing participants greater flexibility in their responses. Three questionnaire versions were developed corresponding to organizational levels (strategic, tactical, operational), each investigating the four research questions through level-appropriate language and framing."

## 📊 RISK ASSESSMENT

### **Risk 1: Low Questionnaire Return Rate**
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** 
- Personal introduction before formal email
- Two reminder emails (Nov 20, Nov 27)
- Extend deadline if needed (Dec 5)
- Use minimum viable sample (10 participants)

### **Risk 2: Short/Superficial Responses**
**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:**
- Questions designed to elicit reflection
- Space for expansion provided
- Optional follow-up conversations if needed
- Thematic saturation may occur with fewer detailed responses

### **Risk 3: Time Constraint for Analysis**
**Likelihood:** Low  
**Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:**
- Analysis framework already prepared
- Chapter 5 template ready
- Coding can begin with first few returns
- Prioritize core participants for deeper analysis
