# SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT & EVALUATION UPDATE
**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Purpose:** Response to Jemina's feedback - "include system development and AI agents"
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All sections updated

---

## 🎯 JEMINA'S FEEDBACK

> "Hi Craig, there is an improvement; however, you did not include any part about developing a system or AI agents. Please revise your research questions to incorporate system development and evaluation."

**Analysis:** Jemina is correct. The previous research questions focused on "design" and "integration" but didn't explicitly mention:
- DEVELOPING/BUILDING the UGENTIC system
- EVALUATING the system's performance
- The system development process itself

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS CHANGED

### **1. PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION**

**BEFORE:**
> Can indigenous African philosophy enhance the design of multi-agent artificial intelligence systems for organizational IT departments, and if so, how does the principle "I am because we are" manifest in both cultural wisdom and technical architecture design?

**AFTER:**
> How can indigenous African philosophy be integrated into the **development** of multi-agent artificial intelligence systems for organizational IT departments, and what is the effectiveness of the **developed UGENTIC system** in enhancing collaborative decision-making when **evaluated** by IT staff experts?

**Key Changes:**
- "enhance the design" → "be integrated into the **development**"
- Added: "the **developed UGENTIC system**"
- Added: "when **evaluated** by IT staff experts"

---

### **2. SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS**

**AFTER:** How can real departmental workflows... be translated into **development requirements** for **building** multi-agent AI systems...

**Key Change:** "design specifications" → "**development requirements** for **building**"

---

#### **RQ2 (System Development - Cultural Integration)**
**BEFORE:** How can cultural philosophy principles... be operationalized in multi-agent AI **system design**...

**AFTER:** How can cultural philosophy principles... be operationalized **during the development** of multi-agent AI systems, and what specific agent behaviors and coordination mechanisms should be **implemented**...

**Key Change:** Focus on **development process** and what should be **implemented**

---

#### **RQ3 (System Evaluation - Effectiveness)**
**BEFORE:** What **design considerations** and potential benefits... **could result** from culturally-enhanced multi-agent systems...

**AFTER:** What are the **evaluated benefits and limitations** of the **developed UGENTIC system**... as **assessed by IT staff experts**?

**Key Changes:**

**BEFORE:** How do IT staff **perceive** the feasibility and value of culturally-driven AI **design**...

**AFTER:** How do IT staff experts **evaluate** the feasibility, value, and organizational fit of the **developed culturally-driven UGENTIC system**...

**Key Changes:**
- "perceive" → "**evaluate**"
- "AI design" → "**developed... UGENTIC system**"

---

#### **RQ5 (System Development - Cultural Authenticity)**
**BEFORE:** How can cultural philosophy be implemented within multi-agent AI **system design**...

**AFTER:** How can cultural philosophy be implemented within **the development** of multi-agent AI systems...

**Key Change:** "system design" → "**the development** of... systems"

#### **RQ6 (System Transferability - Implementation Methodology)**
**BEFORE:** What organizational and cultural factors enable or constrain culturally-driven AI adoption, and what **design methodology** enables other organizations to successfully adopt this framework?

**AFTER:** What **development methodology and implementation guidelines** can be derived from **building the UGENTIC system** to enable other organizations to successfully **develop and adopt** culturally-driven multi-agent AI frameworks?

**Key Changes:**
- "design methodology" → "**development methodology**"

- "**design validation** of culturally-enhanced AI collaboration" → "**empirical evaluation** of the **developed system's effectiveness**"
- "**design recommendations**" → "**documented development methodology** and implementation guidelines"

---

### **5. RESEARCH AIM (Complete Rewrite)**

**BEFORE:**
> To investigate whether indigenous African philosophy can enhance the **design** of multi-agent artificial intelligence systems...

**AFTER:**
> To **develop the UGENTIC multi-agent AI system** that integrates indigenous African philosophy... and to **evaluate its effectiveness** through expert validation, thereby creating a **documented development methodology**...

---

### **6. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**Key Changes:**
- "a critical gap exists in **understanding whether and how AI agents can be designed**..." → "a critical gap exists in **developing and evaluating** multi-agent AI systems..."
- "virtually no research **combines**..." → "virtually no research **has developed and evaluated**..."
- "Absence of validated **design methodologies**..." → "Absence of validated **development methodologies and evaluation frameworks** for **building** AI systems..."
- "Research lacks generalizable **design frameworks**..." → "Research lacks **documented system development approaches** and generalizable **implementation methodologies**... to **build and adopt**..."
- "**using UGENTIC as a prototype to validate**..." → "by **developing the UGENTIC system** as a working prototype and **evaluating its effectiveness**..."
