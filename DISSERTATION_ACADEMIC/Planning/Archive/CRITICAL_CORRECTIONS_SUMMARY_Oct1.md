## üîç **WHY THE HIERARCHY MATTERS**

### **For System Operation:**
1. **Agent Coordination:** Correct hierarchy determines communication paths
2. **Decision Flow:** Strategic ‚Üí Tactical ‚Üí Operational flow must be accurate
3. **Resource Allocation:** IT Manager directly manages 3 operational units
4. **Service Coordination:** Service Desk Manager focuses on IT Support coordination only

### **For Research Validity:**
1. **Accurate Representation:** System must mirror real organizational structure
2. **Transferability:** Other organizations need correct hierarchical model
3. **Ubuntu Integration:** Cultural principles must align with actual reporting relationships
4. **Validation:** Interviews must reflect actual collaboration patterns

1. **Honours_Research_Proposal.md** - Other sections may still reference old hierarchy
2. **SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** - Needs full rewrite with correct info
3. **CRITICAL_ACTIONS_ROADMAP.md** - Timeline needs urgency update
