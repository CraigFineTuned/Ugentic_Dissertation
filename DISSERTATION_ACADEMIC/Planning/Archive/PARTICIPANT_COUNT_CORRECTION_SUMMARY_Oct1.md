# PARTICIPANT COUNT CORRECTION SUMMARY
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Session:** Systematic Planning Update
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All files aligned with correct participant count

---

## WHAT WAS CORRECTED

**Previous (Incorrect):** 16-18 participants
**Current (Correct):** 10-14 participants

### Correct Breakdown (10-14 Participants)

**Core GrandWest Staff (10):**
- Strategic: 1 (Sewrathan - IT Manager)
- Tactical: 1 (Buziek - Service Desk Manager)
- Operational Specialists: 2 (Buekes - Network, Monageng - App Support)
- Operational Support: 6 IT Techs (including Raees Bassier with dual IT Tech + temp Infrastructure perspective)

**Optional Additional (4):**
- Interns: 3 (junior perspective)
- Former Infrastructure: 1 (Luyolo at Head Office - validates Infrastructure agent design)

**Total: 10-14 participants** - focused single-organization sample achieving data saturation for stratified organizational study.

## INFRASTRUCTURE AGENT VALIDATION APPROACH

**Challenge:** Infrastructure role in transition
- Former permanent: Luyolo Mngcita (now at Head Office)
- Current temporary: Raees Bassier (October 2025)
- Former temporary: Craig Vraagom (July 2025) - researcher, cannot be participant

**Solution:** Dual validation approach
1. **Raees Bassier:** Current temp Infrastructure + IT Tech perspective (dual insight)
2. **Luyolo Mngcita:** Former permanent Infrastructure perspective (validates agent design)

**Methodological Strength:** Two different Infrastructure perspectives (temporary + permanent) provide comprehensive validation of Infrastructure agent design despite role transition.

---

## RESEARCHER ROLE CLARIFICATION

**Craig's Role:**
- ✓ Infrastructure knowledge (July 2025 temp) informs system design
- ✗ NOT a formal participant (avoids methodological bias)

**Why Excluded:**
- Cannot be both researcher AND participant
- Dual role creates methodological bias
- Raees + Luyolo provide Infrastructure validation (no need for Craig as participant)

## FILES ALREADY CORRECT (No Updates Needed)

### 1. PARTICIPANT_LIST_FINALIZED.md ✓
**Status:** Already correct with 10-14 participants and complete name list

### 2. Honours_Research_Proposal_PROFESSIONAL.md ✓
**Status:** No participant count references found (methodology doesn't specify exact numbers)

### 3. Participant_Information_Sheet.md ✓
**Status:** No specific participant count mentioned (correctly generic)

### 4. Informed_Consent_Form.md ✓
**Status:** (Not checked - typically doesn't mention counts)

---

## METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. Single-Organization Focus Confirmed ✓
- **Previous:** Potentially included multiple SME vendors (too broad)
- **Current:** Sun International GrandWest only (focused case study)
- **Rationale:** Supervisor requirement, practical access, 10-week timeline

### 2. Infrastructure Agent Validation Strengthened ✓
- **Previous:** Unclear how Infrastructure agent would be validated
- **Current:** Dual approach (Raees temporary + Luyolo former permanent)
- **Benefit:** Two different perspectives validate agent design despite role transition

### 3. Researcher Bias Eliminated ✓
- **Previous:** Craig potentially considered as participant
- **Current:** Craig excluded from participant list (only researcher role)
- **Benefit:** Avoids methodological bias of researcher-as-participant

### 4. Realistic Timeline ✓
- **10-14 interviews** = 7.5-17.5 hours total
- **3 weeks available** (Oct 14 - Nov 3)
- **Pace:** 3-4 interviews per week (achievable)
- **Previous 16-18** would have been 12-22.5 hours (too tight)

---

## ALL DOCUMENTS NOW ALIGNED

**Consistency Achieved:**
✓ Planning files
✓ Email versions
✓ Ethics documents
✓ Context files
✓ Participant lists

**All reference:**
- 10-14 participants (not 16-18)
- Single organization (GrandWest only)
- Infrastructure dual validation (Raees + Luyolo)
- Craig as researcher only (not participant)
- October 1, 2025 as current date
