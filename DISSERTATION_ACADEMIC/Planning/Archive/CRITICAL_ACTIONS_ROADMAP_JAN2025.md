## üî• **WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW (NEXT SESSION)**

**Option A: Literature Enhancement Path**
If you want to complete the foundation first:
1. Search for ITSM framework sources (3-4)
2. Search for IT collaboration sources (2-3)
3. Search for hospitality IT sources (2-3)
4. Search for AI in ITSM sources (2-3)
5. Add all to Harvard_References.md with proper formatting

**Option B: Chapter Writing Path**
If you want to start creating content immediately:
1. Begin Chapter 1 (Introduction) - draft 8-10 pages
2. Use Honours_Research_Proposal.md as foundation
3. Expand with system operational details
4. Set up narrative arc for entire dissertation

**Option C: Dual Track (Recommended)**
Combine both for maximum momentum:
1. Spend 2-3 hours on literature search (add 4-6 critical sources)
2. Spend 3-4 hours drafting Chapter 1 opening sections
3. Build momentum on both fronts simultaneously

**My Recommendation:** **Option C** - Start both literature enhancement and Chapter 1. This maintains progress on two fronts and keeps energy high.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK MANAGEMENT**

### **Risk 1: Interview Scheduling Delays**
**Mitigation:** Start recruitment NOW, even before materials finalized. Personal outreach to IT staff early.

### **Risk 2: Data Analysis Complexity**
**Mitigation:** Begin learning thematic analysis methodology (Braun & Clarke) in February. Practice with pilot data.

### **Risk 3: Writing Paralysis**
**Mitigation:** Write imperfect drafts first. Perfection comes in editing. Get words on page, refine later.

### **Risk 4: Scope Creep**
**Mitigation:** Stick to research questions. Document interesting tangents for "Future Research" section only.

### **Risk 5: Time Pressure (December)**
**Mitigation:** Follow timeline strictly. Complete chapters by July, leaving 5 months for refinement/buffer.

---

## üí™ **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

- ‚úÖ Chapters 1-3 drafted by end of March
- ‚úÖ All interviews completed by end of May
- ‚úÖ Full draft exists by end of September
- ‚úÖ Monthly supervisor check-ins happening
- ‚úÖ Literature remains current (adding sources as needed)

### **Warning Signs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More than 2 weeks without writing progress

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoiding data analysis preparation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Literature gaps not addressed by February
