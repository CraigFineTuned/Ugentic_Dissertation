# PROPOSAL FIX ANALYSIS - October 11, 2025
**Session 13 - Making Proposal 100% Template Compliant**

---

## DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED

### **ISSUE 1: Missing "Proposed Chapter Outline" Section** ❌
**Template Requirement:** Section 10 should be "Proposed Chapter Outline"
**Current Status:** Completely missing
**Fix Required:** Add section showing Chapters 1-7 structure with word counts and purpose

---

### **ISSUE 2: UGENTIC Framing Problem** ❌❌❌
**Jemina's Requirement:** System should be positioned as RESEARCH INSTRUMENT, not main focus
**Current Problem:** Proposal reads like "Look at this cool system we built"
**What She Said:** "The AI system is not the main focus - it's intended to make the research stronger, no different from how interviews enhance research"

#### **Problem Areas:**

**2.1 Abstract - Line 2:**
- ❌ Current: "The study **presents UGENTIC**..."
- ✅ Should be: "To investigate this, the study **uses UGENTIC as a research instrument**..."

**2.2 Section 4.3 Title:**
- ❌ Current: "The UGENTIC Framework" (positions system as subject)
- ✅ Should be: "Research Instrument: The UGENTIC Framework" (positions system as tool)

**2.3 Section 4.3 Opening:**
- ❌ Current: "This study presents UGENTIC..."
- ✅ Should be: "To investigate these questions, this study uses UGENTIC..."

**2.4 Section 4.5:**
- ❌ Current: "Current Status" focused on system completion
- ✅ Should be: Focused on research readiness, system as ready instrument

**2.5 Throughout:**
- ❌ Current: System described as achievement/innovation
- ✅ Should be: System described as methodological tool

---

### **ISSUE 3: Research Focus Clarity** ⚠️
**What Research Is About:**
- ✅ Does Ubuntu philosophy help AI integrate with real work?
- ✅ Do IT staff experience UGENTIC differently than traditional AI?
- ✅ Does collaborative AI improve departmental collaboration?
- ✅ What factors make Ubuntu-driven AI succeed or fail?

**NOT About:**
- ❌ Look at this cool system we built
- ❌ Does UGENTIC work technically?
- ❌ Aren't AI agents amazing?

**Current Problem:** Narrative doesn't consistently emphasize the research questions over the system demonstration

## TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE CHECK

### **Template Structure (from Honours_Research_Proposal template (2).docx):**

| Section | Template Requires | Our Proposal Has | Status |
|---------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | Title Page | Title Page | ✅ |
| 2 | Abstract | Abstract | ⚠️ (framing issue) |
| 3 | Introduction (Background, Problem, Aim) | Separate sections 3-5 | ✅ (acceptable) |
| 4 | Research Questions | Research Questions | ✅ |
| 5 | Research Objectives | Research Objectives | ✅ |
| 6 | Literature Review | Literature Review | ✅ |
| 7 | Research Methodology | Research Methodology | ✅ |
| 8 | Expected Outcomes | Expected Outcomes | ✅ |
| 9 | Limitations and Delimitations | Limitations and Delimitations | ✅ |
| 10 | **Proposed Chapter Outline** | **MISSING** | ❌ |
| 11 | (implied Timeline) | Timeline and Milestones | ✅ |
| 12 | References | References | ✅ |

### **Additional Sections We Have (Not in Template but Acceptable):**
- Section 8: Hypothesis ✅
- Section 9: Significance of the Study ✅
- Section 12: Ethical Considerations ✅
- Section 16: Resources and Requirements ✅
- Section 17: Conclusion ✅
- Section 19: Appendices ✅

**Assessment:** These additions are acceptable as they strengthen the proposal. Jemina didn't flag them in the October 10 meeting.

---

## STATISTICS VERIFICATION ✅

**Issue:** Where does "35% productivity LOST" claim come from?

**Resolution (Session 12):**
- ❌ REMOVED: "35% productivity LOST" (misleading composite figure)
- ✅ ADDED: "77% of workers report increased workload from AI" (Upwork, 2024)
- ✅ ADDED: "35% of employees lack clarity on AI application" (Robinson, 2024)
- ✅ Both properly cited in References section

**Current Status:** ✅ CORRECTED

---

## JEMINA'S 5 MEETING POINTS - COMPLIANCE CHECK

### **1. Question-Objective Alignment** ✅
**Requirement:** Direct 1:1 alignment (RQ1→RO1, etc.)
**Current Status:** ✅ ACHIEVED - Perfect alignment with "Addresses RQ#" labels
**Section:** 6 & 7

### **2. UGENTIC as Research Instrument** ❌
**Requirement:** System should strengthen research, not be the focus
**Current Status:** ❌ NEEDS FIX - Currently framed as main achievement
**Fix Needed:** Reframe throughout as methodological tool

### **3. Ubuntu Rationale** ✅
**Requirement:** Explicit "Why Ubuntu?" section
**Current Status:** ✅ ACHIEVED - Section 4.2 with 4 reasons
**Quote:** "Company policy changes, but philosophy does not"

### **4. Methodology Foundation** ✅
**Requirement:** Robust methodology guided by Question-Objective alignment
**Current Status:** ✅ ACHIEVED - Strong methodology chapter
**Section:** 11

### **5. Clarity** ⚠️
**Requirement:** Clear focus without confusion or jargon
**Current Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT - System framing creates confusion about research focus
**Fix Needed:** Clarify that research is about Ubuntu-AI bridging workplace gaps, NOT about demonstrating the system

---

## FIX PRIORITY LIST

### **CRITICAL (Must Fix):**
1. ❌ Add "Proposed Chapter Outline" section (Section 10)
2. ❌ Reframe Abstract - UGENTIC as research instrument
3. ❌ Rewrite Section 4.3 - Tool not achievement
4. ❌ Adjust Section 4.5 - Research readiness not system status
5. ❌ Update Contents to show correct section numbering

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix):**
6. ⚠️ Throughout: Change "presents UGENTIC" to "uses UGENTIC as research instrument"
7. ⚠️ Throughout: Emphasize research questions over system demonstration
8. ⚠️ Ensure all sections focus on research aims, not technical achievements

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have):**
9. Consider adding brief system description to Methods section instead of prominent section
10. Ensure Introduction clearly states "This research investigates..." not "This research presents..."
