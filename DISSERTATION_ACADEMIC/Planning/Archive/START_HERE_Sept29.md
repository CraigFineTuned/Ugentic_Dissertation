**Last Updated:** September 29, 2025
**Purpose:** Single entry point for ALL dissertation sessions
**Status:** STABLE - This file rarely changes

---

## üéØ **INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE:**

Read this file in order:

### **Step 1: Read the Main Context (ALWAYS)**
```
C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md
```

**This file contains:**
- Complete current system state
- All 6 agents with correct hierarchy
- Current research status (60% complete)
- Timeline and deadlines (2 months remaining)
- **"LATEST SESSION CHANGES" section at the top** (what happened last session)
- **Dynamic references to additional files** (if needed)

### **Step 2: Follow Instructions in That File**

The `NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md` file will tell you:
- What changed in the most recent session
- Which additional files to read (if any) using FULL PATHS
- What the next action is
- Any critical information you need

---

## üìã **FOR CRAIG: YOUR SESSION START COMMAND**

**Copy and paste this EXACT command every time:**

```
Read this file:
C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\START_HERE.md
```

**That's it.** One complete file path. No more. No less.

This file will route Claude to everything else using FULL PATHS.

---

## üîí **WHY THIS WORKS:**

1. **Single Entry Point** - You only provide ONE full file path
2. **Dynamic Routing** - NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md points to other files using FULL PATHS
3. **Self-Updating** - Each session updates the context file to reference new changes
4. **No Explanation Needed** - Files explain everything to Claude
5. **Scalable** - Works whether there are 2 files or 20 files
6. **No Ambiguity** - FULL PATHS prevent any confusion

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL RULE:**

**NEVER use relative paths or just filenames.**

**ALWAYS use complete full paths like:**
- ‚úÖ `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\FILE.md`
- ‚ùå `Planning/FILE.md`
- ‚ùå `FILE.md`

---

## üîÑ **MAINTENANCE:**

**This file (START_HERE.md):**
- Almost never changes
- Only update if the full path to NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md changes

**NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md:**
- Updates "LATEST SESSION CHANGES" section each session
- Always uses FULL PATHS when referencing other files
- Acts as the middleware/router

**Other files:**
- Created/updated as needed
- Referenced through the context file using FULL PATHS
- Never need to be directly provided by you
