**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Purpose:** Submit revised research proposal incorporating system development and evaluation
**Status:** READY TO SEND

## EMAIL DRAFT

**To:** Jemini Matiya (jemini.matiya@richfield.ac.za)
**Subject:** Research Proposal Revised - System Development & Evaluation Focus

---

Dear Jemina,

Thank you for your feedback on the research proposal. You were absolutely correct—the previous version focused on "design" and "integration" but didn't explicitly emphasize that this research is about **developing and evaluating the UGENTIC system**.

I have comprehensively revised the proposal to address your feedback:

### **Key Changes Made:**

**1. Primary Research Question** - Now explicitly asks:
- How indigenous African philosophy is integrated into the **development** of the system
- What the effectiveness of the **developed UGENTIC system** is when **evaluated** by experts

**2. All Six Secondary Questions** - Now categorized as:
- **System Development** (RQ1, RQ2, RQ5): How to build the system with cultural integration
- **System Evaluation** (RQ3, RQ4): How to assess its effectiveness and feasibility
- **System Transferability** (RQ6): How to document the development methodology for replication

**3. Research Objectives** - All seven objectives updated to maintain 1:1 alignment with questions, emphasizing system development and expert evaluation

**4. Abstract** - Rewritten to start with "This research **develops and evaluates** UGENTIC..." rather than "investigates whether..."

**5. Research Aim** - Now explicitly states: "To **develop the UGENTIC multi-agent AI system**... and to **evaluate its effectiveness**..."

**6. Problem Statement** - Emphasizes the gap in "**developing and evaluating**" multi-agent AI systems with cultural integration

**7. Expected Outcomes** - Leads with "the **fully developed UGENTIC system**" and "**empirical evaluation evidence**" as primary deliverables

### **The Proposal Now Clearly States:**

✅ We are **DEVELOPING** the UGENTIC system (not just designing concepts)
✅ We are **BUILDING** six AI agents with specific roles and behaviors
✅ We are **EVALUATING** the developed system through expert assessment
✅ The development methodology will be **DOCUMENTED** for others to replicate

All other sections (Literature Review, Methodology, References) remain strong and required no changes. The proposal still maintains:
- All 60 references from 2020-2025 (80% from 2024-2025)
- Design Science Research methodology framework
- Question-Objective 1:1 alignment

I've attached the updated proposal. Please let me know if this now appropriately captures the system development and evaluation focus, or if any further revisions are needed.

Thank you for your guidance in strengthening this research.

Best regards,

## ALTERNATIVE SHORTER VERSION

**To:** Jemini Matiya (jemini.matiya@richfield.ac.za)
**Subject:** Research Proposal Revised - System Development & Evaluation

Dear Jemina,

Thank you for your feedback. You were absolutely right—I've now comprehensively revised the proposal to explicitly incorporate system development and evaluation.

**Key Changes:**
- Primary question now asks about **developing** the UGENTIC system and **evaluating** its effectiveness
- All six secondary questions categorized as System Development, System Evaluation, or System Transferability
- Research objectives updated to emphasize building and evaluating the system
- Abstract rewritten to lead with "develops and evaluates UGENTIC"
- Expected outcomes emphasize the fully developed system and empirical evaluation

The proposal now clearly states we are **DEVELOPING** a system with six AI agents and **EVALUATING** its effectiveness through expert assessment.

All other sections remain strong (60 references 2020-2025, DSR methodology, 1:1 alignment maintained).

Please review the updated proposal and let me know if any further revisions are needed.

Best regards,
