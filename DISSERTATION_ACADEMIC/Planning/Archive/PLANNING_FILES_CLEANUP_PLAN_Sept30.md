# PLANNING FILES CLEANUP PLAN
**Dissertation File Architecture Rationalization**
**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Purpose:** Eliminate outdated planning files and maintain only current, accurate documentation

---

## üéØ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

Multiple planning files contain **severely outdated information** from January-February 2025:
- References to "46 sources" (actually 56)
- Timeline showing "10 months remaining" (actually 9.5 weeks)
- Dates saying "February 2025 (THIS MONTH)" when we're in September
- Outdated completion percentages
- References to non-existent file locations

**This creates confusion and risks using wrong information.**

---

## ‚úÖ **FILES TO KEEP (CURRENT & ACCURATE)**

### **1. START_HERE.md** ‚úÖ
**Status:** KEEP - Current and accurate  
**Last Updated:** September 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Single entry point for all sessions  
**Action:** NO CHANGES NEEDED

### **2. NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md** ‚úÖ
**Status:** KEEP - Current and accurate  
**Last Updated:** September 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Complete system state and context  
**Contains:**
- Latest session changes (Sep 30, 2025)
- Current system state (6 agents operational)
- Accurate timeline (9.5 weeks remaining)
- 56 sources reference
- Emergency 10-week plan reference

**Action:** NO CHANGES NEEDED

### **3. SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md** ‚úÖ
**Status:** KEEP - Current and accurate  
**Last Updated:** September 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Latest session summary with emergency plan  
**Contains:**
- Emergency 10-week execution timeline
- Critical timeline discovery (9.5 weeks not 10 months)
- Immediate action items
- Week-by-week breakdown

**Action:** NO CHANGES NEEDED

### **4. Honours_Research_Proposal_PROFESSIONAL.md** ‚úÖ
**Status:** KEEP - Just created  
**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Purpose:** Professional proposal for Word document conversion  
**Contains:**
- Complete professional format
- All current accurate information
- 56 sources
- Current timeline and status

**Action:** USE THIS FOR WORD DOCUMENT

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **FILES TO UPDATE OR ARCHIVE**

### **Decision Required: Update vs Archive**

For each file below, choose ONE:
- **Option A:** UPDATE to current September 2025 reality
- **Option B:** MOVE TO ARCHIVE (keep for reference but don't use)

---

### **5. CRITICAL_ACTIONS_ROADMAP.md** ‚ùå
**Status:** SEVERELY OUTDATED  
**Created:** January 29, 2025  
**Problems:**
- Says "February 2025 (THIS MONTH)"
- References "46 sources" (actually 56)
- Timeline shows "10 months remaining" (actually 9.5 weeks)
- Suggests adding 8-12 ITSM sources (already added)
- Completion status is 60% (actually 65%)

**RECOMMENDATION:** **ARCHIVE** - Useful historical reference but SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md replaces it with current emergency plan

**Action if ARCHIVE:**
```
Move to: Planning/Archive/CRITICAL_ACTIONS_ROADMAP_JAN2025.md
```

**Action if UPDATE:** Would need complete rewrite matching SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (redundant)

---

### **6. KNOWLEDGE_INVENTORY.md** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** PARTIALLY OUTDATED  
**Problems:**
- References "46 sources" (actually 56)
- References old file locations (V8/DISSERTATION_FINAL/)
- Some useful inventory information

**RECOMMENDATION:** **UPDATE** - Core inventory concept useful, just needs current numbers and locations

**Action if UPDATE:**
- Change "46 sources" to "56 sources"
- Update file location references to current structure
- Update completion percentages to 65%
- Remove references to V8/DISSERTATION_FINAL/

**Action if ARCHIVE:**
```
Move to: Planning/Archive/KNOWLEDGE_INVENTORY_JAN2025.md
```

---

### **7. Proposal_Alignment_Assessment.md** ‚ùå
**Status:** SEVERELY OUTDATED  
**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Problems:**
- Entire assessment from January 2025
- References "46 sources"
- Outdated timeline assumptions
- Completion percentages wrong
- No longer reflects current proposal

**RECOMMENDATION:** **ARCHIVE** - Historical assessment no longer relevant with new professional proposal

**Action if ARCHIVE:**
```
Move to: Planning/Research_Proposal/Archive/Proposal_Alignment_Assessment_JAN2025.md
```

**Action if UPDATE:** Would need complete reassessment against new proposal (time-intensive, low priority)

---

### **8. Comparative_Analysis_SunInt_vs_UGENTIC.md** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** UNKNOWN (need to check)  
**Action:** READ and determine if current or outdated

---

### **9. FILES_READY_FOR_SUPERVISOR.md** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** UNKNOWN (likely outdated)  
**Action:** READ and determine if still relevant or archive

---

### **10. FILES_UPDATED_WITH_ACTUAL_STAFF.md** ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Action:** READ and determine if duplicates info in NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md

---

### **14. LITERATURE_ENHANCEMENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md** ‚ùå
**Status:** LIKELY OUTDATED  
**Assumption:** Probably from literature enhancement session adding to 46 sources
**Action:** READ to confirm, likely archive as SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md is current

---

### **15. READY_TO_SEND_SUMMARY.md** ‚ùå
**Status:** LIKELY OUTDATED  
**Action:** READ to confirm, likely archive as current submission status known

---

### **16. SESSION_HANDOFF.md** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** UNKNOWN  
**Action:** READ and determine relevance

---

### **17. SESSION_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üìã **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS - PRIORITY ORDER**

### **IMMEDIATE (Do Today - 30 minutes):**

**1. Create Archive Folder**
```bash
Create: Planning/Archive/January2025_Outdated/
```

**2. Archive Definitely Outdated Files**
Move these to Archive:
- CRITICAL_ACTIONS_ROADMAP.md ‚Üí Archive/January2025_Outdated/
- Proposal_Alignment_Assessment.md ‚Üí Archive/January2025_Outdated/
- LITERATURE_ENHANCEMENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md ‚Üí Archive/January2025_Outdated/ (if outdated)
- READY_TO_SEND_SUMMARY.md ‚Üí Archive/January2025_Outdated/ (if outdated)

**3. Quick Read Unknown Files** (10-15 files, 2 mins each = 30 mins)
For each file #8-20 above:
- Open and scan first few lines
- Check date
- Determine: KEEP / UPDATE / ARCHIVE

---

### **SHORT-TERM (This Week - 1-2 hours):**

**4. Update Useful Files**
If KNOWLEDGE_INVENTORY.md chosen to UPDATE:
- Change all "46 sources" to "56 sources"
- Update file location references
- Update completion percentages
- Remove outdated sections

**5. Create New Streamlined Planning Structure** (Optional but recommended)

**Proposed Minimal Structure:**
```
Planning/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ START_HERE.md (entry point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md (system state)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (latest session)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CURRENT_WEEK_ACTIONS.md (this week's tasks - OPTIONAL NEW)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ January2025_Outdated/ (historical files)
```

---

## üéØ **DECISION FRAMEWORK**

For each uncertain file, ask:

**1. Is the information current (Sep 2025)?**
- ‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Keep or update
- ‚ùå NO ‚Üí Archive

**2. Is it redundant with START_HERE or NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT?**
- ‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Archive
- ‚ùå NO ‚Üí Consider keeping

**3. Will it be used in next 4 weeks?**
- ‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Keep or update
- ‚ùå NO ‚Üí Archive

**4. Does it contain unique valuable information?**
- ‚úÖ YES ‚Üí Update or keep
- ‚ùå NO ‚Üí Archive

---

## ‚úÖ **FINAL CLEAN STRUCTURE GOAL**

**After Cleanup:**
```
Planning/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ START_HERE.md                              [ENTRY POINT]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md     [SYSTEM STATE]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md              [LATEST SESSION]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CURRENT_WEEK_ACTIONS.md (optional)         [THIS WEEK]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Research_Proposal/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Comparative_Analysis_SunInt_vs_UGENTIC.md (if current)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ January2025_Outdated/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CRITICAL_ACTIONS_ROADMAP_JAN2025.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Proposal_Alignment_Assessment_JAN2025.md
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ KNOWLEDGE_INVENTORY_JAN2025.md (if archived)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other outdated files]
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Only current information in active directory
- ‚úÖ No confusion about what's accurate
- ‚úÖ Historical files preserved in Archive
- ‚úÖ Clear entry point (START_HERE.md)

   - Check date in first few lines
   - Note: KEEP / UPDATE / ARCHIVE
3. Make list of decisions
```

### **Step 2: Create Archive (2 minutes)**
```bash
1. Create folder: Planning/Archive/January2025_Outdated/
2. Optional: Create Archive/README.md explaining what's archived and why
```

### **Step 3: Move Outdated Files (5 minutes)**
```bash
For each file marked ARCHIVE:
1. Move to Archive/January2025_Outdated/
2. Rename with _JAN2025 suffix for clarity
3. Check it's not referenced by any KEEP files
```

### **Step 4: Update Keeper Files (30-60 minutes)**

2. Check Archive/ folder - should see outdated files preserved
3. Test: Open START_HERE.md and follow path to NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md
4. Confirm no broken references
```

- Hard to know what's accurate

### **AFTER (Cleaned State):**
- 3-4 core planning files (all current)
- All information from Sep 2025
- Clear single source of truth
- Historical files preserved but clearly separated
- Easy to maintain going forward

- Move to Archive, don't delete
- Historical context may be useful later
- Safe to preserve everything, just organize it

**Test After Cleanup:**
- Make sure START_HERE.md still works
- Verify no broken file references
- Check that current files are self-contained

**Update Going Forward:**
- Only update the 3-4 core files
- Create new session summaries as needed
- Archive old session summaries monthly

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

Cleanup is successful when:
- ‚úÖ All files in active Planning/ folder are current (Sep 2025)
- ‚úÖ No conflicting information between files
- ‚úÖ Historical files preserved in Archive
- ‚úÖ Clear entry point (START_HERE.md) works
- ‚úÖ You can confidently use any file in Planning/ without checking dates

**Next Step:** Choose how to proceed:
1. **Quick Audit:** Spend 15 minutes checking files #8-20 and make decisions
2. **Immediate Archive:** Move definitely outdated files right now
3. **Full Cleanup:** Do entire process in one 1-2 hour session

**Your decision on how to proceed?**
