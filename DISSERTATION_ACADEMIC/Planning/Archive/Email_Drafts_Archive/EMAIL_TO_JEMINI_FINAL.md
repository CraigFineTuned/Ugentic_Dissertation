**Subject:** Revised Research Proposal - Focused Single Case Study

---

Dear Jemini,

I'm revising my approach based on your recent guidelines. My previous proposal was too broad (multiple SME vendors). Here's the focused version:

**New Title:**
"Development and Validation of a Ubuntu-Driven Multi-Agent AI System for IT Departmental Collaboration: A Case Study of Sun International GrandWest IT Departments"

**What It Solves:**
IT departments struggle with siloed operations and slow cross-functional collaboration. This research validates whether AI agents can practically bridge real departmental workflows to improve coordination - proving AI-human integration feasibility in organizational IT contexts using Ubuntu philosophy.

**Research Contribution:**
First empirical validation of Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI integrated with real IT departments, providing organizations with a proven methodology for AI-enhanced collaboration that respects human expertise.

**Key Changes:**
- **Single organization:** Sun International GrandWest IT departments (not multiple SME vendors)
- **70% IT focus:** Multi-agent AI architecture, RAG systems, algorithm design, system development
- **Practical deliverable:** UGENTIC framework (already operational with 6 AI agents)
- **Data collection:** 10-14 interviews with GrandWest IT staff across all organizational levels

**Timeline:**
- Ethics submission: This week
- Interviews: October
- First draft chapters: First week of October (as required)
- Final submission: December 5, 2025

The attached proposal provides full details. I'm ready to proceed immediately upon your approval.

May I move forward with this focused approach?

**Kind regards,**
