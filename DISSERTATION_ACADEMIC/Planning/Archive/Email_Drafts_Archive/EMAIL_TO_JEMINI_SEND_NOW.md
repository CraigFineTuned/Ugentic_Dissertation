**Subject:** Revised Research Proposal - Timeline Clarification

---

Dear Jemini,

I've completed the revised research proposal incorporating your guidelines. The attached MS Word document provides the full details.

**Research Title:**
"Ubuntu-Driven Multi-Agent AI System for IT Departmental Collaboration: A Case Study of Sun International GrandWest IT Departments"

**Compliance with Your Requirements:**
✅ 70%+ IT focus: Multi-agent AI, RAG systems, system architecture, algorithm design  
✅ Clear topic format: Specific IT solution + Case study organization  
✅ MS Word format: Attached as requested  
✅ Single case study: GrandWest IT departments (not multiple vendors)  
✅ Questionnaires ready: Comprehensive interview protocols complete  

**Timeline Clarification:**
I must transparently communicate a constraint:
- Ethics application submitted today (October 1)
- Ethics approval typically takes 1-2 weeks
- Interviews cannot begin without ethics approval
- This makes a full draft by first week of October impossible

**Alternative Timeline:**
- Chapters 1-3 (Introduction, Literature, Methodology): October 13
  - These don't require interview data and can be reviewed early
- Full draft with Results/Discussion: November 18
  - After interview data collection and analysis complete
- Final submission: December 5, 2025

This ensures research quality while respecting ethics requirements. Is this acceptable?

**Research Significance:**
This is the first empirical validation of Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI integrated with real IT departments - providing both academic contribution and practical organizational value. The system is already operational with 6 AI agents validated against actual GrandWest workflows.

I'm ready to proceed immediately and committed to delivering high-quality research on schedule.

**Kind regards,**
