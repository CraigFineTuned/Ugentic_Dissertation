  * **RO2:** Cultural Authenticity & Validation (refined old RO3)
  * **RO3:** System Evaluation (merged old RO5+RO6)
  * **RO4:** Transferability & Implementation Methodology (kept old RO4)

- ‚úÖ **Reduced from 6 to 4 Research Questions** (maintaining 1:1 alignment):
  * RQ1 ‚Üí addresses RO1 (Development & Cultural Integration)
  * RQ2 ‚Üí addresses RO2 (Cultural Authenticity)
  * RQ3 ‚Üí addresses RO3 (System Evaluation)
  * RQ4 ‚Üí addresses RO4 (Transferability)

#### **3. Complete Literature Review Restructure**
- ‚úÖ **Section 6.1:** Multi-Agent AI Systems & Development Requirements (Addresses RO1)
  * Added explicit statement: "This body of literature directly informs RO1..."
  * Demonstrates technical foundations BEFORE system development

- ‚úÖ **Section 6.2:** Cultural Philosophy & Authenticity (Addresses RO2)
  * Added explicit statement: "These works guide our approach to RO2..."
