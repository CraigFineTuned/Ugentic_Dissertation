# JEMINA MEETING NOTES - October 10, 2025

**Meeting Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Attendees:** Craig Vraagom, Jemina Matiya (Supervisor)  
**Purpose:** Review research proposal and provide guidance for corrections  
**Outcome:** 6 critical requirements identified for proposal revision  
**Action Taken:** Session 12 (October 11, 2025) - All requirements implemented

---

## WHAT I LEARNED FROM THE MEETING

### 1. QUESTION-OBJECTIVE ALIGNMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE) ✅

**What Jemina Said:**
The "Questions" in our proposal need to **directly align with our "Objectives" and aim**. This guides the entire dissertation, so that we do not lose focus and branch off irrelevantly.

**The Template:**
She gave me `Honours_Research_Proposal template (2).docx` as a sample template. This both guides and outlines discrepancies with our current dissertation.

**Key Principle:**
One research question → One research objective (1:1 correspondence)  
This creates intellectual coherence and prevents scope creep.

**Action Taken (Session 12):**
- Created RQ1-6 with perfect alignment to RO1-6
- Each objective explicitly states "Addresses RQ#"
- Clear path: AIM → Questions → Objectives → Methods → Results

---

### 2. UGENTIC IS RESEARCH INSTRUMENT, NOT MAIN FOCUS ✅

**What I Specifically Mentioned:**
The AI system we are creating is **not intended to be the main focus** - but instead, is intended to make the research stronger. It is no different from how our interviews are intended to enhance our research.

**Research Questions Should Focus On:**
- ✅ "Does Ubuntu philosophy help AI integrate with real work?"
- ✅ "Do IT staff experience UGENTIC differently than traditional AI?"
- ✅ "Does collaborative AI actually improve departmental collaboration?"
- ✅ "What factors make Ubuntu-driven AI succeed or fail?"

**NOT About:**
- ❌ "Look at this cool system we built"
- ❌ "Does UGENTIC work technically?"
- ❌ "Aren't AI agents amazing?"

**Core Focus:**
It is about exploring the gaps between real life organization and AI-workplace gaps and profound questions and ideas to potentially bridge it based on our research.

**Action Taken (Session 12):**
- Throughout proposal, UGENTIC called "research instrument" or "research tool"
- Never called "research subject" or "main focus"
- Research questions framed about Ubuntu-AI integration, not system demonstration

---

### 3. WHY UBUNTU? (PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION) ✅

**What I Told Her:**
Since company policy changes, a philosophy does not - **"I am, because we are"**.

**The Rationale:**
It works not only for cultural grounds for AI, but also the foundation to an ever-changing AI world that will constantly evolve, but not lose the human aspect, or "Ubuntu".

**Key Points:**
1. **Stability:** Philosophy endures while policies change
2. **Cultural Foundation:** Human-centered framework for AI
3. **Human Aspect:** Technology evolves but doesn't lose humanity
4. **Structural Coherence:** Not just metaphor - multi-agent systems ARE Ubuntu contexts

**Action Taken (Session 12):**
- Added Section 4.2: "Why Ubuntu Philosophy?"
- Four explicit reasons documented
- Quote from meeting incorporated into proposal

---

### 4. METHODOLOGY AND ROBUST FOUNDATION ✅

**What Was Discussed:**
The methodology, choosing the right path, and having a robust foundation, ultimately guided by the **Question-Objective based logic alignment** for this guideline.

**The Goal:**
In the end, it can create a relationship for strong intellectual research.

**Action Taken (Session 12):**
- Methodology chapter already strong (Session 8)
- Question-Objective alignment now provides foundation
- Clear research design path established

---

### 5. CLARITY IS NON-NEGOTIABLE ✅

**What Jemina Emphasized:**
The Question-Objective with clear aims and alignment should be clear, and **this is not negotiable!**

**The Standard:**
If she goes about reading the proposal, she should have the clear idea with what the dissertation is about, **without unnecessary confusion and jargon** that may mislead the reader.

**Action Taken (Session 12):**
- Simplified structure with clear labels (RQ1-6, RO1-6)
- Explicit Research Aim statement
- Professional but accessible language
- Logical flow: AIM → Questions → Objectives → Methods

---

### 6. STATISTICS CORRECTION (35% PRODUCTIVITY CLAIM) ✅

**My Question:**
"Research shows: 35% productivity LOST because AI doesn't align with how people actually work together. Where on earth does this referenced research come from? Please help."

**The Answer - COMPOSITE FIGURE (MISLEADING):**
While a single, authoritative study with a definitive "35% productivity loss" figure is not readily available, the referenced claim appears to be a **composite of findings from multiple reports** published in 2024.

**The Correct Statistics:**

#### **77% of Workers Report Increased Workload from AI:**
**Source:** Upwork Research Institute (2024)

**Harvard Reference:**
```
Winsome Marketing (2025) '77% of workers say AI has increased their workload'. 
Available at: https://winsomemarketing.com/ai-in-marketing/77-of-workers-say-ai-has-increased-their-workload 
[Accessed: 10 October 2025].
```

**Note:** The Winsome Marketing article summarizes the Upwork Research, so it serves as an accessible source. The official Upwork report itself is referenced but not directly available.

#### **35% of Employees Lack Clarity on AI Application:**
**Source:** GoTo study via Forbes

**Harvard Reference:**
```
Robinson, B. (2024) '77% of employees confused about using AI at work', Forbes, 
9 September. Available at: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2024/09/09/77-of-employees-lost-on-how-to-use-ai-in-their-careers-new-study-shows/ 
[Accessed: 10 October 2025].
```

**Note:** This Forbes article reports on multiple studies, including the GoTo research that found 35% of employees were unsure what tasks AI could help with.

**Why the Composite Figure is Misleading:**
When referencing this topic, it is important to cite the more accurate figures from the original research rather than relying on the combined, and likely misreported, "35% productivity lost" number. 

**The Key Takeaway:**
The misalignment between leadership and employees regarding AI adoption, which creates burdens rather than boosting productivity.

**Action Taken (Session 12):**
- REMOVED: "35% productivity LOST" claim (misleading)
- ADDED: "77% increased workload" (Upwork, 2024)
- ADDED: "35% lack clarity" (Robinson, 2024)
- Both properly cited in References section
