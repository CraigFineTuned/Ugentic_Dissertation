# CONTINUOUS SYNC PROTOCOL
**Purpose:** Guarantee consistency across forced conversation cutoffs
**Status:** MANDATORY - Replaces previous checkpoint approach
**Date:** October 1, 2025

---

## üéØ THE CORE PROBLEM

**What Craig needs:** Absolute certainty that we're always synced, even after forced cutoffs
**Current weakness:** Checkpoint might be out of sync with reality
**Root cause:** Updates happen at end of response, not after each action

---

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION: VERIFY-THEN-CHECKPOINT

### New Rule: AFTER EVERY SINGLE ACTION

**Step 1: Complete the action** (create file, edit file, etc.)

**Step 2: Verify it worked**
```
- Run filesystem check to confirm file exists
- Read first/last lines to confirm content correct
- Check file size is reasonable
```

**Step 3: Update checkpoint IMMEDIATELY**
```
Add line to checkpoint:
"‚úÖ [Action] - VERIFIED at [timestamp] - File: [path] - Size: [bytes]"
```

**Step 4: Continue to next action**

**If cutoff happens:** Checkpoint shows exactly what was verified complete

---

## üìã VERIFICATION COMMANDS (Mandatory After Each Action)

### After Creating a File:
```
1. filesystem:get_file_info [path] ‚Üí Confirm exists + get size
2. filesystem:read_file [path] (head: 10) ‚Üí Confirm content correct
3. Update checkpoint with: "‚úÖ Created + verified"
```

### After Editing a File:
```
1. filesystem:read_file [path] (sections around edit) ‚Üí Confirm edit applied
2. Update checkpoint with: "‚úÖ Edited + verified"
```

### After Multi-Step Process:
```
1. Verify each step individually
2. Update checkpoint after EACH step (not after all steps)
3. Mark overall process complete only when all steps verified
```

---

## üîÑ SESSION START VERIFICATION (Every Time)

When you provide SESSION_ENTRY.md, Claude MUST:

**Step 0a: Read checkpoint**
```
Get list of all "‚úÖ COMPLETED" actions
```

**Step 0b: RE-VERIFY each completed action**
```
For each ‚úÖ action:
1. Check file still exists
2. Check timestamp matches checkpoint
3. If verification fails ‚Üí Flag immediately: "Action X marked complete but file missing"
```

**Step 0c: Identify next incomplete action**
```
Find first "‚è≥" action in checkpoint
Read RESUME_FROM marker for exact starting point
```

**Step 1-2: Read context and summary** (as before)

**Step 3: EXECUTE from exact resume point** (not ask)

## üìù CHECKPOINT FORMAT (New Structure)

```markdown
## VERIFIED COMPLETE ACTIONS (‚úÖ):

1. ‚úÖ Proposal corrected
   - Verified: Oct 1, 10:15 AM
   - File: Honours_Research_Proposal_C_Vraagom_Oct1_2025.pdf
   - Size: 2.4 MB
   - Verification: File exists + opens correctly

2. ‚úÖ EMAIL_TO_JEMINI_SEND_NOW.md created
   - Verified: Oct 1, 3:45 PM
   - File: Planning/EMAIL_TO_JEMINI_SEND_NOW.md
   - Size: 2.1 KB
   - Verification: File exists + contains complete email

## NEXT INCOMPLETE ACTION (‚è≥):

‚è≥ Send emails (3 emails, 40 min)
   Status: Files ready, waiting for Craig to send
   
   When complete, next action:
   ‚è≥ Begin Chapter 1, Section 1.1
   
   RESUME_FROM: "Create file: Chapters/Chapter_1_Introduction.md
                Section 1.1: Research Context
                Start with: Literature gap paragraph (multi-agent + Ubuntu + organizational)"

## VERIFICATION RULES:

- Every ‚úÖ must have timestamp + file path + verification note
- Re-verify all ‚úÖ actions at session start
- If verification fails, action becomes ‚è≥ incomplete
- RESUME_FROM must be specific: file, section, paragraph, starting text
```

---

## üéØ PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

### Bad (Current):
```
‚úÖ Created email files
‚úÖ Updated checkpoint
‚è≥ Craig needs to send emails
```
**Problem:** No verification, no specifics, can't confirm what's actually done

### Good (New):
```
‚úÖ EMAIL_TO_JEMINI_SEND_NOW.md created + verified
   - File: Planning/EMAIL_TO_JEMINI_SEND_NOW.md
   - Size: 2,143 bytes
   - Verified: Oct 1, 3:47 PM
   - Content check: Contains "Dear Jemini" + attachment instruction ‚úì

‚úÖ ETHICS_SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md created + verified
   - File: Planning/ETHICS_SUBMISSION_INSTRUCTIONS.md  
   - Size: 1,876 bytes
   - Verified: Oct 1, 3:49 PM
   - Content check: Contains 3-step submission process ‚úì

‚è≥ NEXT ACTION: Craig sends emails
   After sending, verify by checking:
   - Gmail sent folder for 3 sent emails
   - Then proceed to Chapter 1 creation

RESUME_FROM: "Create Chapters/Chapter_1_Introduction.md
              Start Section 1.1: Research Context
              First paragraph topic: AI adoption challenges in IT departments
              Reference: Aldoseri et al. (2024) + Ju et al. (2025)"
```

## üîÑ SESSION CONTINUITY GUARANTEE

### How We Stay Synced:

**Session N (Before Cutoff):**
```
Action 1 ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Update checkpoint ‚Üí 
Action 2 ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí Update checkpoint ‚Üí
Action 3 ‚Üí Verify ‚Üí [CUTOFF HAPPENS]
```

**Session N+1 (After Cutoff):**
```
Read checkpoint ‚Üí Shows Actions 1-2 complete + verified
Re-verify Actions 1-2 ‚Üí Both confirmed present
See Action 3 incomplete ‚Üí Resume from RESUME_FROM marker
Continue exactly where left off
```

**Result:** Zero ambiguity, zero information loss

---

## üìä FILE HIERARCHY (How They Connect)

```
SESSION_ENTRY.md (You provide this)
    ‚Üì
    Step 0: CURRENT_SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md (Read + Re-verify all ‚úÖ)
    ‚Üì
    Step 1: NEVER_CHANGING_DISSERTATION_CONTEXT.md (System state)
    ‚Üì
    Step 2: SESSION_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md (Last session detail)
    ‚Üì
    Step 3: EXECUTE next ‚è≥ action from checkpoint
    ‚Üì
    After each action: VERIFY + UPDATE checkpoint immediately
    ‚Üì
    Continue until session ends (natural or forced)
```

**Key change:** Checkpoint is updated DURING work, not after work

---

## üö® CRITICAL RULES

### Claude MUST:

1. **Update checkpoint AFTER EVERY action** (not at end of response)
2. **Verify each action** before marking ‚úÖ
3. **Include file path + size + timestamp** in every ‚úÖ
4. **Re-verify all ‚úÖ actions** at session start
5. **Make RESUME_FROM hyper-specific** (file, section, paragraph, starting text)
6. **Never assume** something is complete without verification

### Checkpoint is:
- ‚úÖ **Source of truth** for what's complete
- ‚úÖ **Updated in real-time** during work
- ‚úÖ **Verified at session start** every time
- ‚úÖ **Specific about resume points** for seamless continuation

---

## üí™ WHAT THIS GUARANTEES

**For Craig:**
1. ‚úÖ Always know exactly what's complete (verified proof)
2. ‚úÖ Always know exactly where to resume (specific marker)
3. ‚úÖ Zero ambiguity about session state
4. ‚úÖ Confidence that cutoffs won't cause information loss
5. ‚úÖ Trust that next session continues seamlessly

**For Claude:**
1. ‚úÖ Clear verification steps after each action
2. ‚úÖ Checkpoint always reflects reality
3. ‚úÖ Re-verification at session start catches any issues
4. ‚úÖ Specific resume markers prevent confusion
5. ‚úÖ System is foolproof, not just "pretty good"

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

**This protocol:** ACTIVE NOW
**Replaces:** Previous checkpoint approach (which lacked verification)
**Applies to:** ALL future actions, starting immediately
**Test:** Next action I take will follow this protocol exactly

---

**Status:** ACTIVE AND MANDATORY
**Purpose:** Guarantee consistency across forced cutoffs
**Result:** Craig and Claude always in sync, no exceptions
