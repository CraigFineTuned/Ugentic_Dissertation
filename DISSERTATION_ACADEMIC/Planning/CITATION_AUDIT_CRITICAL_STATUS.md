## ü§î POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS

Why so many citations not found:

1. **Memory-based citations:** You may have cited from memory and need to verify actual sources
2. **Year errors:** Multiple citations may have wrong years (like Davenport & Ronanki)
3. **Author format errors:** Some citations may have simplified author names
4. **Unpublished/In press:** Some 2024-2025 sources may not yet be published
5. **Different context:** Some citations may be from different papers by same authors

---

## ‚ö° NEXT STEPS

**What I need from you:**

1. **Verify each problematic citation** - Check your notes, original sources
2. **Correct any errors** - Author names, years, contexts
3. **Provide guidance** - Which citations should I continue searching for?
4. **Confirm action** - Should I:
   - Wait for your verification before continuing?
   - Update Chapter 1 with Davenport & Ronanki correction now?
   - Create a corrected citation list for you to verify?

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

**PAUSE CITATION AUDIT** until you verify problematic citations. This will:
- Prevent wasting searches on incorrect citations
- Ensure reference file gets correct additions
- Save time by focusing on actual sources

**Then:** Resume with verified citations, complete searches, update references
