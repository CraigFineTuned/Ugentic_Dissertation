**Research Purpose:**
I've developed an AI system (UGENTIC) that uses multiple AI agents to represent different IT departments. I want to validate this system by interviewing IT staff about their workflows, collaboration patterns, and how Ubuntu principles appear in daily work.

- All interviews confidential and anonymized in final dissertation

- Optional: Interns and Luyolo (at Head Office)

**Timeline:**
