# SESSION 35 - SELF-ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT PLAN
**Created:** October 23, 2025 - Session 35
**Foundation:** `C:\Users\craig\Desktop\MainProjects\Ugentic_Dissertation\DISSERTATION_ACADEMIC\Planning\SESSION_ENTRY.md`
**Purpose:** Comprehensive roadmap for making all dissertation files self-enforcing with explicit rules
**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Increment 1 of 12 complete

---

## üéØ PROJECT OBJECTIVE

**Problem:** Files don't contain their own rules/standards at the top, requiring SESSION_ENTRY.md to hold all knowledge.

**Solution:** Add self-enforcing headers to every key file so rules are discovered automatically when SESSION_ENTRY.md links to them.

**Vision:** When analyzing SESSION_ENTRY.md and subsequent file linkage, ALL rules are self-contained in each file.
