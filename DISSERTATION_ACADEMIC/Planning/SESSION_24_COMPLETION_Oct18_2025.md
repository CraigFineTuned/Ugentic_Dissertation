1. **Ubuntu Core Principles:**
   - Interconnectedness and relationality ("I am because we are")
   - Communalism vs. individualism
   - Collective responsibility
   - Contextual fairness
   - Epistemological access

2. **Ubuntu Operationalization (Odero et al. 2024):**
   - 9 operationalized themes for AI ethics
   - Communal data stewardship, collective responsibility, contextual fairness, etc.

---

### **2. DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH AS PHILOSOPHICAL INQUIRY**

**Research Accomplished:**
- Identified 6 DSR sources (up from 2)
- Found **Haj-Bolouri et al. (2025)** - phenomenological approach to DSR
- Located **Tuunanen et al. (2024)** - dealing with complexity using design echelons
- Established epistemological foundation for using artifacts as philosophical probes

**Key Insights:**
- DSR can investigate philosophical questions through artifact creation
- System development generates **design knowledge** about philosophy-technology relationships
- **Theory-practice nexus** (Zeng & Han, 2025) - theoretical conceptualization through practice
- DSR enables philosophical inquiry while maintaining IT domain focus

---

### **3. REFLEXIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS - LATEST METHODOLOGY**

**Sources Added:**
- **5 Braun & Clarke sources** (2022-2025)

---

### **4. PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH QUESTION FRAMEWORKS**

**Exemplar Papers Analyzed:**
- 10 papers showing IT+philosophy balance strategies
- Postphenomenological approaches
- Experimental philosophy of technology
- Critical theory in AI ethics

**Four Framing Strategies Identified:**
1. **Definitional/Conceptual:** "What is X in context of Y technology?"
2. **Mediational/Relational:** "How does technology X mediate concept Y?"
3. **Comparative/Critical:** "How does philosophy X relate to technical phenomenon Y?"
4. **Normative/Evaluative:** "How should we develop Z from perspective Y?"

**Balance Achievement Patterns:**
- 70% IT domain context (organizational, workflows, field site)
- 30% philosophical depth (meaning, authenticity, tensions)
- Technology as context AND method for investigating philosophy

---

### **5. STRATEGIC CLARITY ON KEY TENSIONS**

**Resolved 70% IT Focus Paradox:**
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT:** 70% IT domain context (organizational IT, workflows, collaboration challenges)
- ‚ùå **INCORRECT:** 70% system documentation or technical architecture details

**Clarified UGENTIC System Role:**
- ‚úÖ **IS:** Research probe/instrument (Design Science Research artifact)
- ‚úÖ **IS:** Method to investigate Ubuntu philosophy operationalization
- ‚ùå **NOT:** Research subject or primary contribution

**Established Ubuntu Approach:**
- ‚úÖ **SUBJECT** of philosophical inquiry
- ‚úÖ **Critically engaged** (including critiques and limitations)
- ‚úÖ **African scholars centered** (not extractive)
- ‚ùå **NOT:** Superficial branding or decoration

---

## üéØ STRATEGIC INSIGHTS GAINED

### **1. The Correct Understanding of "70% IT Focus"**

**Revelation:** 70% IT focus does NOT mean 70% technical documentation.

**Correct Interpretation:**
- 70% = IT domain as research field (organizational IT departments)
- 70% = IT problems and contexts (collaboration, workflows, service delivery)
- 70% = IT practitioners as stakeholders (not just technical architecture)

**Impact on Dissertation:**
- Can be highly philosophical while maintaining IT focus
- Ubuntu philosophy investigated **in IT context** = 70% IT domain
- UGENTIC system provides IT field site for philosophical inquiry

---

### **2. Design Science Research as Philosophical Method**

**Revelation:** DSR is not just for building artifacts - it's a legitimate philosophical inquiry method.

**Key Insight from Haj-Bolouri et al. (2025):**
- Phenomenological approach to DSR
- Artifacts as probes for philosophical investigation
- Design tensions reveal philosophical truths
- "Sense-making of meaning" through artifact creation

**Impact on Dissertation:**
- UGENTIC becomes research instrument, not research subject
- System development = philosophical inquiry process
- Technical challenges = philosophical tensions made visible
- Design decisions = philosophical insights documented

---

### **3. Ubuntu Philosophy's Depth and Complexity**

**Revelation:** Ubuntu is NOT simple "we over me" - it's a sophisticated relational ontology with significant scholarly debate.

**Key Realizations:**
- Multiple interpretations across African cultures
- Feminist critiques of traditional Ubuntu (De Vries, Patel et al.)
- Operationalization challenges (Matolino)
- Not universally positive - contains tensions and contradictions

**Impact on Dissertation:**
- Must engage critically, not superficially
- Need to address multiple Ubuntu interpretations
- Acknowledge limitations and critiques
- Focus on specific operationalization (Odero et al.'s 9 themes)

---

### **4. Methodological Congruence is Critical**

**Revelation:** Can't mix positivist language with interpretivist research.

**From Braun & Clarke (2024):**
- No "bias," "accuracy," "reliability," "saturation" in reflexive TA
- Themes don't "emerge" - researcher constructs them
- Subjectivity is resource, not problem
- Quality criteria must match philosophical stance

**Impact on Dissertation:**
- Careful language choices throughout
- Explicit about philosophical positioning
- Researcher reflexivity acknowledged
- Appropriate quality criteria (not positivist metrics)

---

### **5. African Scholars Must Be Centered**

**Revelation:** Ubuntu research by non-African scholars can be extractive if not careful.

**Ethical Approach Established:**
- Prioritize African scholars (Metz, Ramose, Mugumbate, Mhlambi, etc.)
- Engage with diverse African perspectives
- Acknowledge positionality as non-African researcher (Craig)
- Avoid appropriation or romanticization

**Impact on Dissertation:**
- 32 Ubuntu sources, majority by African scholars
- Critical engagement with multiple perspectives
- Explicit researcher positionality statement needed
- Cultural sensitivity throughout analysis
