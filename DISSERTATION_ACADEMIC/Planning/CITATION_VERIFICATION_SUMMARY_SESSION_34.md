## ‚ùå CITATIONS NOT FOUND / REQUIRING VERIFICATION (4 Citations)

### **1. Mkhize, 2022** ‚ùå
**Chapter:** Chapter 1  
**Claimed Content:** "Ubuntu philosophy provides cultural stability as a bridging mechanism"  
**Search Result:** NOT FOUND

**Issue Details:**
- Searched for: "Mkhize 2022 Ubuntu cultural stability bridging mechanism"
- Found: Multiple references to **Mkhize, N. (2008)** "Ubuntu and harmony: An African approach to morality and ethics"
- NO 2022 publication found on claimed topic
- Also found: Mkhize et al., 2024 on corruption (NOT about Ubuntu bridging)

**Recommendation:**
- Likely **year error** - should probably cite **Mkhize, N. (2008)** instead
- HOWEVER: 2008 is pre-2020 and violates 5-year requirement
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Either:
  1. Find actual Mkhize 2022+ publication, OR
  2. Find alternative 2020+ source for "cultural stability as bridging mechanism" concept, OR
  3. Remove claim if no supporting source exists

---

### **2. Haj-Bolouri et al., 2025** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Chapter:** Chapter 3  
**Claimed Content:** "DSR as philosophical inquiry"  
**Search Result:** RESEARCHER FOUND, NO 2025 PAPER YET

**Issue Details:**
- Searched for: "Haj-Bolouri 2025 design science research philosophical inquiry"
- Found: Amir Haj-Bolouri confirmed as legitimate DSR/philosophy researcher at University West, Sweden
- Found: Multiple publications on DSR, ADR, and philosophy (2015-2022)
- NOT FOUND: Specific 2025 publication on "DSR as philosophical inquiry"

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Paper may be in press (accepted but not yet published)
2. Conference paper not yet indexed in databases
3. Year error (may be 2024 or earlier)
4. Working paper or preprint not widely available

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Verify if paper actually exists
- Check for 2024 publication by same authors
- If paper doesn't exist, find alternative 2020+ DSR philosophy source
- Consider: vom Brocke et al. (2020) or Tuunanen et al. (2024) may cover philosophical aspects

---

### **3. Kanter, 2020** ‚ùå
**Chapter:** Chapter 1  
**Claimed Content:** "Departmental silos impede cross-functional collaboration"  
**Search Result:** NOT FOUND

**Issue Details:**
- Searched for: "Kanter 2020 departmental silos cross-functional collaboration"
- Found: Concept widely discussed in organizational literature
- Found: Multiple sources discuss departmental silos (2023-2025)
- NOT FOUND: Any publication by "Kanter" in 2020 on this topic

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Wrong author name
2. Wrong year
3. Memory-based citation (concept but no actual source)

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Check original source notes for correct attribution
- If citation doesn't exist, find alternative 2020+ source for silos concept
- Organizational silos are well-documented - should be easy to find replacement
- Consider: Bean (2025) or other organizational AI sources may cover silos

---

### **4. Dafoe et al., 2024** ‚ùå
**Chapter:** Chapter 4  
**Claimed Content:** "Individual agent optimization"  
**Search Result:** NO RESULTS

**Issue Details:**
- Searched for: "Dafoe 2024 AI individual agent optimization multi-agent systems"
- Result: NO search results returned at all
- This suggests incorrect citation, unpublished work, or wrong authors

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Verify citation from original notes
- Check if authors or year are correct
- If citation doesn't exist, find alternative source for "individual agent optimization" concept
- This is a fundamental multi-agent concept - should be well-documented in literature

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CITATIONS WITH ATTRIBUTION CONCERNS (3 Citations)

### **1. Odero et al., 2024** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Chapter:** Chapter 1  
**Claimed Content:** "identifies nine operationalization themes for Ubuntu in AI contexts"  
**Search Result:** PAPER EXISTS - BUT ATTRIBUTION CONCERN

**Issue Details:**
- **FOUND:** Odero, B., Nderitu, D. and Samuel, G. (2024) 'The Ubuntu Way: Ensuring Ethical AI Integration in Health Research', *Wellcome Open Research*, 9, p.625.
- **PAPER IS LEGITIMATE** and exists in your references (under different author order: Mahamadou et al., 2024)
- **HOWEVER:** The "nine operationalization themes for Ubuntu in AI contexts" appears to be from **Mutswiri et al. (2025)** (already in your references), NOT from Odero et al. (2024)

**Evidence:**
- Mutswiri et al. (2025) paper explicitly discusses: "Nine recurrent themes are identified, including communal data stewardship, collective responsibility, contextual fairness..."
- Odero et al. (2024) focuses on healthcare ethics but doesn't present "nine operationalization themes"

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Verify Chapter 1 - check which paper actually discusses the nine themes
- If nine themes are from Mutswiri et al. (2025), cite that paper instead
- If claim is from Odero et al., verify exact content match

---

### **2. Birhane, A. (2021)** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Chapter:** Chapter 1  
**Claimed Content:** "Multi-agent systems where agents are literally defined by their relationships... structurally embody Ubuntu's relational ontology"  
**Search Result:** RESEARCHER FOUND - CONTENT MISMATCH

**Issue Details:**
- **FOUND:** Abeba Birhane is legitimate AI ethics researcher at Trinity College Dublin
- **Main 2021 paper:** "Algorithmic injustice: A relational ethics approach" in *Patterns*, 2, pp. 1-6
- **HOWEVER:** Paper focuses on relational ethics and Ubuntu, NOT specifically on "multi-agent systems" or "Ubuntu ontology"
- The specific claim about agents being "defined by their relationships" doesn't match Birhane's actual content

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Verify Chapter 1 claim about "multi-agent systems/Ubuntu ontology"
- May need to:
  1. Reframe the claim to match what Birhane actually discusses (relational ethics), OR
  2. Find different source that explicitly discusses multi-agent + Ubuntu ontology, OR
  3. Split citation: Birhane for "relational ethics", different source for "multi-agent embodiment"

---

### **3. Ncube, 2024** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Chapter:** Chapter 4  
**Claimed Content:** "Shared ownership, communal decision-making"  
**Search Result:** PARTIALLY FOUND

- **ALSO FOUND:** Kolawole & Ncube (2024) - "Rethinking Ownership, Power and Policy in Drug Patents: The Case for an Ubuntu-Infused Approach"
- **STATUS:** Ncube exists as Ubuntu researcher with 2024 publications

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Verify which specific Ncube paper is being cited
- Verify the paper actually discusses "shared ownership" and "communal decision-making" in the context claimed

---

### **2. Braun, Clarke & Rance (2014 - NOT 2024)** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Chapter:** Chapter 3  
**Claimed Content:** "Reflexive thematic analysis"  
**Search Result:** YEAR ERROR

**Issue Details:**
- **FOUND:** Braun, V., Clarke, V., & Rance, N. (2014) - "How to use thematic analysis with interview data"
- **PAPER IS FROM 2014, NOT 2024**

**Recommendation:**
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Chapter 3 needs to decide which citation to use:
  1. **Braun & Clarke (2024)** - RTARG guidelines (most recent, already in references), OR
  2. **Braun, Clarke & Rance (2014)** - Original how-to guide (but pre-2020)
- If using 2014 paper, violates 5-year requirement
