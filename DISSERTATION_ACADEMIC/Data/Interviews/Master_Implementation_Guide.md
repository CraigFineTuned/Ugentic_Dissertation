4.  **Brief Supervisor:**
    -   Send all created documents to Jemini Matiya for final review.

**Week 2:**
5.  **Set Up Secure Storage:**

    -   Designate a locked cabinet for physical consent forms.
6.  **Send Recruitment Emails:**
    -   Using the template below, email the target participants.
    -   Start with a pilot group of 4-5 people you have a good rapport with.
7.  **Schedule Pilot Interviews:**
    -   Begin scheduling the first 2-3 interviews for Week 3.
8.  **Start Reflexivity Journal:**
    -   Create a new document. Your first entry should detail your expectations and potential biases.

### **RECRUITMENT EMAIL TEMPLATE**

**Subject:** Invitation to Participate in a Research Study on Improving IT Collaboration

**Dear [Participant Name],**

My name is Craig Vraagom, and in addition to my role in the IT department, I am completing my Honours dissertation at Richfield University.

I am conducting a research study to understand how we can improve collaboration and workflows within our IT department. The goal is to help validate a new AI framework designed to support our team, not replace us, using principles of Ubuntu (community, mutual support).

I would be grateful for your expert insights. This would involve a confidential 45-60 minute interview to discuss your experiences. Your participation is completely voluntary, and all your feedback will be anonymized.

Please see the attached Participant Information Sheet for full details.

Would you be open to participating? If so, please let me know what time would be convenient for you.

Thank you for considering this request.

**Best regards,**

**Craig Vraagom**

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 2: DATA COLLECTION (WEEKS 3-6)**

**Goal:** Conduct 16-18 high-quality semi-structured interviews.

**Weeks 3-6:**
1.  **Conduct Interviews (3-4 per week):**
    -   Use the appropriate interview protocol for each participant's level (Strategic, Tactical, Operational).
    -   Follow all ethical guidelines (consent, recording, etc.).
    -   Take brief observational notes during the interview.
2.  **Post-Interview Debrief:**
    -   Immediately after each interview, write detailed notes in your reflexivity journal.
    -   Note key themes, surprising insights, and any difficulties.
3.  **Transcription:**
    -   Begin transcribing interviews as soon as they are completed. You can use a transcription service (e.g., Otter.ai) but must anonymize the output manually.
    -   Aim to have each interview transcribed within 48 hours.
4.  **Secure Data:**
    -   Store recordings and transcripts in your encrypted folder.
    -   File signed consent forms in your locked cabinet.

---

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 3: DATA ANALYSIS (WEEKS 7-9)**

**Goal:** Analyze qualitative data using Braun & Clarke's Thematic Analysis.

**Week 7: Familiarization & Coding**
1.  **Read Transcripts:** Read through all transcripts multiple times to immerse yourself in the data.
2.  **Initial Coding:** Begin line-by-line coding. In a separate column or using software (e.g., NVivo, or even just comments in a Word doc), create short codes that summarize the meaning of each sentence/paragraph.
    -   *Example Code: "Frustration with information access"*

**Week 8: Theme Development**
3.  **Group Codes:** Start grouping related codes into potential themes.
    -   *Example: Group "Frustration with info access," "Slow handoffs," and "Siloed knowledge" under a potential theme called "Coordination Barriers."*
4.  **Develop Thematic Map:** Create a visual map (whiteboard, Miro, etc.) showing the relationships between your codes and themes.

**Week 9: Reviewing & Defining Themes**
5.  **Review Themes:** Check if your themes work in relation to (a) the coded extracts and (b) the entire data set. Refine, merge, or split themes as needed.
6.  **Define and Name Themes:** Write a detailed analysis for each theme, explaining its meaning and providing supporting quotes from the transcripts.

### **UBUNTU-SPECIFIC CODING SCHEME**

In addition to emergent themes, specifically look for evidence of Ubuntu principles:

-   **Code: UBUNTU-INTERDEPENDENCE:** Statements about teamwork, relying on others, collective success.
-   **Code: UBUNTU-SUPPORT:** Examples of helping colleagues, sharing knowledge, mentorship.
-   **Code: UBUNTU-COMMUNITY:** Expressions of belonging, team identity, positive relationships.
-   **Code: UBUNTU-SERVANT-LEADERSHIP:** (For managers) Statements about empowering the team, putting team needs first.
-   **Code: UBUNTU-COLLECTIVE-GOOD:** Decisions made for the benefit of the whole department/organization.

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 4: SYSTEM TESTING & QUANTITATIVE DATA (WEEKS 10-11)**

**Goal:** Gather quantitative data and user feedback on the operational UGENTIC system.

**Week 10: Pre-Test Metrics**
1.  **Baseline Metrics:** Collect baseline performance data for the week *before* the test.
    -   Average ticket resolution time.
    -   Number of escalations between teams.
    -   User satisfaction scores (if available).

**Week 11: Live System Test**
2.  **Deploy UGENTIC:** Run the live UGENTIC system for one full week.
3.  **Collect Test Metrics:** Gather the same metrics as the baseline week.
4.  **Observational Data:** Observe how the team interacts with the system. Note any confusion, successes, or workarounds.

---

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 5: FOLLOW-UP & SYNTHESIS (WEEKS 12-13)**

**Goal:** Triangulate findings and gather comparative insights.

**Week 12: Follow-Up Interviews**
1.  **Conduct Follow-Up Interviews:** Interview 8-10 of the original participants.
2.  **Focus:** Ask about their experience during the test week. Compare it to their previous experiences. Did the AI help? What were the challenges?

**Week 13: Data Synthesis**
3.  **Analyze Quantitative Data:** Compare pre-test and test metrics using simple statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests).
4.  **Integrate Findings:** Synthesize the findings from the initial interviews, the quantitative data, and the follow-up interviews. Where do the different data sources confirm or contradict each other?

---

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 6: DISSERTATION WRITING (WEEKS 10-16)**

**Goal:** Write Chapters 4 and 5 of the dissertation.

**Chapter 4: Implementation & Results**
-   **Part 1: Qualitative Results:** Present the themes from your thematic analysis, using anonymized quotes as evidence.
-   **Part 2: Quantitative Results:** Present the comparison of your pre-test and test metrics.
-   **Part 3: System Interaction:** Describe how the team used the UGENTIC system.

**Chapter 5: Discussion**
-   **Interpret Findings:** What do your results mean? How do they answer your research questions?
-   **Connect to Literature:** How do your findings confirm, contradict, or extend the existing literature (your 56+ sources)?
-   **Discuss Ubuntu Integration:** How successfully did the system embody Ubuntu? What was the impact?
-   **Limitations:** What were the limitations of your study?
-   **Recommendations:** What are your practical recommendations for Sun International and theoretical recommendations for future research?
