## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOUR DISSERTATION:

In Chapter 3 (Methodology), you'll need to say:

> "Data was collected through written questionnaires rather than recorded interviews, allowing participants to respond at their convenience and provide thoughtful written reflections on their experiences."

This is a **valid research method** - just slightly different from what the detailed interview prep guides assumed (which were for recorded face-to-face interviews).

**That's it! Much simpler than recorded interviews.**
