## SECTION C: UBUNTU-AI BRIDGING - INFRASTRUCTURE AGENT (10 minutes)
**RQ3: Stakeholder validation for infrastructure**

### **Infrastructure Agent Concept:**

*"The UGENTIC system includes an Infrastructure Agent embodying Ubuntu principles:*

- ***Systems Awareness:*** Acknowledges how infrastructure changes affect applications, network, service desk
- ***Collective Responsibility:*** Frames infrastructure stability as team achievement
- ***Knowledge Sharing:*** Makes complex infrastructure concepts accessible to non-specialists
- ***Proactive Support:*** Anticipates infrastructure needs affecting other functions
- ***Transparent Changes:*** Explains infrastructure decisions in business terms

*The agent reports to IT Manager (matching your structure) and coordinates with specialist peers and service desk."*

### **C1. Infrastructure Complexity Bridging:**
*"Could these Ubuntu behaviors help bridge the gap between infrastructure complexity and other IT functions' understanding?"*

**Probes:**
- Would systems awareness improve coordination?
- Would transparent explanations reduce misunderstandings?
- Would knowledge sharing democratize infrastructure understanding?

### **C2. Change Coordination:**
*"Would Ubuntu collective framing improve infrastructure change management?"*

**Probes:**
- Currently individual accountability?
- Would collective framing reduce change anxiety?
- Better coordination across functions?

### **C3. Infrastructure Isolation:**
*"Infrastructure can be isolated from other IT functions. Would Ubuntu mutual support principles reduce this?"*

**Probes:**
- Currently feel isolated?
- Would proactive support improve integration?
- Would peer collaboration approach help?

### **C4. Technical-Organizational Gap:**
*"Infrastructure often has technical excellence but organizational coordination gaps. Could Ubuntu bridge this?"*

**Probes:**
- Technical focus vs business impact communication?
- Would Ubuntu help translate technical to organizational?
- Realistic or idealistic?

---

## SECTION D: INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSFERABILITY (5 minutes)
**RQ4: Design principles for infrastructure roles**

### **D1. Infrastructure-Specific Requirements:**
*"For Ubuntu-AI to work in infrastructure roles, what's essential?"*

**Probes:**
- Technical depth vs accessibility balance?
- Documentation quality?
- Change management integration?

### **D2. Other IT Departments:**
*"Would this Ubuntu-infrastructure approach work in other organizations?"*

**Probes:**
- Size considerations?
- Complexity levels?
- Cultural readiness?
