**Africa Social Work Network (2025)** - *Ubuntu Interview Guide Sample*
- **Source:** africasocialwork.net (May 2025)
- **Key Questions Adopted:**
  * "What is your understanding of Ubuntu?"
  * "Can you share a memory where Ubuntu was lived (not just spoken about)?"
  * "How does Ubuntu shape conflict resolution or resource sharing?"
  * "Are there tensions between Ubuntu values and modern economic/political systems?"
- **Application:** These exact question formats used in Section 1 of protocol

- **Application:** 
  * Protocol designed for reflexive TA approach
  * Researcher reflexivity built into post-interview notes
  * Themes anticipated based on Ubuntu philosophy literature
  * Open-ended questions allow participant meaning-making

---

### **4. Ubuntu-AI Ethics Literature**

**Odero, B., et al. (2024)** - *The Ubuntu Way: Ensuring Ethical AI Integration in Health Research*
- **Journal:** Wellcome Open Research
- **Warning:** Scholars reference to Ubuntu without critical analysis may lead to portraying it as absolute
- **Key Concern:** Must acknowledge Ubuntu variations across African cultures, not present as monolithic
- **Application:** Section 6.5 questions explicitly ask about authenticity vs. appropriation
- **Quote:** "We must be cautious to avoid its misappropriation...and acknowledge its inherent limitations"

---

**Gwagwa, A., et al. (2022)** - *The Role of African Value of Ubuntu in Global AI Inclusion*

---

**Frempong, G., & Kadam, R. (2024)** - *Harmonizing AI and Human Values: Ubuntu Approach to Super Alignment*
- **Conference:** HCI International 2024
- **Proposal:** Multidimensional assessment scale for Ubuntu-AI alignment
- **Core Pillars:** Empathy, sustainability, conflict resolution, communal harmony
- **Application:** Section 6.2 questions ask what Ubuntu values should guide AI design
- **Quote:** "Integrating Ubuntu principles...presents a revolutionary shift from individualistic to collective value framework"

---

## üéØ PROTOCOL DESIGN RATIONALE

### **Why Start with Ubuntu Understanding? (Section 1)**

**Theoretical Basis:**
Africa Social Work Network recommends starting with open Ubuntu inquiry, then moving to lived experience examples. This prevents:
- Leading participants with researcher's definition
- Imposing Western interpretations
- Missing cultural variations and nuances

**Methodological Basis:**
Tayali's ethnographic study emphasized capturing Ubuntu through lived experiences, not abstract definitions. Our protocol:
- Asks for specific memories and stories
- Probes for workplace examples
- Identifies authentic vs. performative Ubuntu

---

### **Why Explore Hierarchy-Ubuntu Tensions? (Section 2.2)**

**Theoretical Basis:**
Msila's Ubuntu workplace framework acknowledges tension between hierarchical organizations and Ubuntu's egalitarian principles. Questions explore:
- Can servant leadership exist in formal hierarchies?
- Does organizational structure undermine Ubuntu?
- How do staff navigate competing values?

**Research Gap:**
Most literature assumes Ubuntu and hierarchy conflict, but Sipondo (2025) argues participative leadership and collectivism can coexist with formal structures. Our protocol investigates this empirically.

---

### **Why Ask About Policies & Processes? (Section 3)**

**Theoretical Basis:**
Ubuntu workplace studies examine how formal HR policies either support or undermine Ubuntu values. IT policies (SLAs, escalation protocols, ticket assignment) may:
- Encourage silos (anti-Ubuntu)
- Promote collaboration (pro-Ubuntu)
- Create tensions between efficiency and community

**Practical Relevance:**
UGENTIC agents operate within these formal processes. Understanding policy-Ubuntu alignment reveals implementation constraints.

---

### **Why Extensive Ubuntu-AI Integration Questions? (Section 6)**

**Philosophical Basis:**
Odero et al. (2024) warn that Ubuntu in AI can become appropriation if not critically examined. Section 6 questions:
- Test cultural authenticity vs. "African-washing"
- Explore philosophical contradictions
- Identify practical barriers
- Validate stakeholder perception

**Research Novelty:**
Frempong & Kadam (2024) propose Ubuntu-AI alignment but lack empirical stakeholder validation. Our protocol provides this missing empirical component.

---

## üîç ANTICIPATED THEMES (For Thematic Analysis)

Based on literature review, we anticipate these themes emerging from interviews:

### **THEME 1: Authentic Ubuntu vs. Corporate Performance**

**Literature Basis:**
- Msila notes organizations may use Ubuntu rhetoric without genuine practice
- Questions 9-10 probe this directly

**Expected Findings:**
- Participants distinguish "real Ubuntu" from "management slogans"
- Examples of both authentic community and performative teamwork
- Criteria for Ubuntu authenticity in IT context

---

### **THEME 2: Hierarchy Navigating Ubuntu Egalitarianism**

**Literature Basis:**
- Sipondo identifies tension between authority structures and Ubuntu collectivism
- Questions 13-14, 41-42 explore this

**Expected Findings:**
- Participants acknowledge hierarchy-Ubuntu tension
- Examples of servant leadership vs. command-and-control
- Strategies for balancing formal structure with community values

---

### **THEME 3: Ubuntu as "We" vs. Western "I"**

**Literature Basis:**
- Ubuntu's "I am because we are" contrasts with Western individualism
- Udah et al. (2025) discuss Ubuntu's challenge to Western professional paradigms

**Expected Findings:**
- Collective vs. individual success definitions
- Tension between personal performance metrics and team outcomes
- Knowledge sharing vs. knowledge hoarding

---

### **THEME 4: Can Technology Embody Philosophy?**

**Literature Basis:**
- Recent literature proposes Ubuntu-AI integration but acknowledges conceptual challenges

**Expected Findings:**
- Skepticism about AI practicing Ubuntu
- Criteria for authentic vs. superficial Ubuntu in AI
- Distinction between AI as tool vs. AI as community member

---

### **THEME 5: South African IT Context**

**Literature Basis:**
- Ubuntu workplace research emphasizes Sub-Saharan African context specificity
- Questions 7-8, 45-46 explore cultural relevance

**Expected Findings:**
- Ubuntu's relevance in modern technical work
- Generational differences in Ubuntu understanding
- Tensions between global IT standards and local culture

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR

### **Reflexive Thematic Analysis Alignment**

Braun & Clarke (2024) emphasize methodological coherence between research values, interview design, and analysis approach.

**Protocol Coherence:**
1. **Research Values:** Non-positivist, interpretive, culturally grounded
2. **Interview Design:** Open-ended, experience-focused, meaning-making
3. **Analysis Approach:** Reflexive TA (not coding reliability)

**Quality Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Questions allow participant meaning-making (not just data extraction)
- ‚úÖ Researcher reflexivity built into protocol (post-interview notes)
- ‚úÖ Flexibility for emergent themes (not rigid predetermined codes)
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu as lived experience, not imposed definition

---

### **Cultural Sensitivity & Decolonization**

Udah et al. (2025) argue for decolonizing research by centering indigenous knowledge systems.

**Protocol Decolonization:**
- ‚úÖ Ubuntu understanding comes from participants, not researcher
- ‚úÖ Lived experience privileged over textbook definitions
- ‚úÖ Multiple Ubuntu interpretations accepted (not monolithic)
- ‚úÖ Critical examination of appropriation risks (Q45-46)
- ‚úÖ Language flexibility (English/Afrikaans/indigenous terms)

---

### **Ethical Considerations**

Odero et al. (2024) emphasize Ubuntu's own ethical framework for research: communal consent, collective benefit, relational accountability.

**Ubuntu Research Ethics:**
- ‚úÖ Participants positioned as knowledge holders, not data sources
- ‚úÖ Research aims to benefit IT community, not just researcher
- ‚úÖ Findings will be shared with GrandWest IT (relational accountability)
- ‚úÖ Anonymization protects individuals while honoring community knowledge
