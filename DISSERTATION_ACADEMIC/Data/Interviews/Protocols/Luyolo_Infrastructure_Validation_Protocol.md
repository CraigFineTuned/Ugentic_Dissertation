## METHODOLOGICAL VALUE

**Why Luyolo's Interview is Critical:**
- **Historical Validation:** Confirms Infrastructure agent design based on actual role experience
- **External Perspective:** Head Office position provides unbiased comparative view
- **Role Transition Validation:** Validates agent design despite current staff transition
- **Dual Validation Strategy:** Combined with Raees (current temp), provides robust Infrastructure coverage

**Addresses Methodological Concern:**
- Infrastructure role transition doesn't compromise research
- Dual validation (former permanent + current temp) is methodologically stronger than single perspective
- External position reduces insider bias
- Historical view provides established role understanding

---
