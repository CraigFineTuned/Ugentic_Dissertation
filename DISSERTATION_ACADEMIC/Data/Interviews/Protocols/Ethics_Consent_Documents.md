# DOCUMENT 1: PARTICIPANT INFORMATION SHEET

**Study Title:** Bridging Real-World IT Operations with Ubuntu-Driven AI Agents

**Researcher:** Craig Vraagom, Honours Student, Richfield University

**Supervisor:** Jemini Matiya

## 1. INVITATION

You are invited to participate in a research study exploring how to better integrate AI agents into real-world IT departments using the African philosophy of Ubuntu. This study is for my Honours dissertation at Richfield University. As you are an IT professional at Sun International GrandWest, your insights are invaluable.

## 2. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

The goal is to understand the current challenges and collaboration methods in your IT department. This information will help validate an AI system (the UGENTIC framework) designed to support your team's work in a way that respects your expertise and fosters collaboration, guided by Ubuntu principles of community and mutual support.

## 3. WHAT IS INVOLVED?

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to:
- Participate in one 45-60 minute interview about your work, challenges, and team culture.
- With your permission, the interview will be audio-recorded to ensure accuracy.
- You may be invited for a brief 30-minute follow-up interview in a few weeks to discuss experiences after the AI system has been tested.

## 4. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION

Your participation is completely voluntary. You can refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without any penalty or negative consequences. You can also skip any questions you don't wish to answer.

## 5. CONFIDENTIALITY & ANONYMITY

All information you provide will be kept strictly confidential.
- Your name and any identifying details will be removed from the data.
- In reports and publications, you will be referred to by a pseudonym (e.g., "IT Technician A").
- Audio recordings will be stored securely on an encrypted drive and deleted after transcription.
- Transcripts and consent forms will be stored securely in a locked cabinet and on an encrypted drive, accessible only to me and my supervisor.
- All data will be destroyed 5 years after the study is complete.

## 6. RISKS & BENEFITS

- **Risks:** There are no major risks. Some may feel discomfort discussing workplace challenges. You can stop at any time.
- **Benefits:** Your insights will directly contribute to creating more human-centered AI for IT operations. You will also be contributing to pioneering research in African AI ethics.

## 7. CONFLICT OF INTEREST (RESEARCHER'S DUAL ROLE)

Please be aware that I, Craig Vraagom, am both the researcher and a member of the IT Support team. I will manage this dual role by:
- Treating all your responses with strict confidentiality.
- Using a reflexive journal to separate my experiences from yours.
- Ensuring my analysis is reviewed by my supervisor for objectivity.
- My role as a researcher is completely separate from my role as a colleague. Your participation (or non-participation) will have no impact on our professional working relationship.

## 8. CONTACT INFORMATION

If you have any questions, please contact:
- **Researcher:** Craig Vraagom, [Your Email], [Your Phone Number]
- **Supervisor:** Jemini Matiya, [Supervisor's Email]
