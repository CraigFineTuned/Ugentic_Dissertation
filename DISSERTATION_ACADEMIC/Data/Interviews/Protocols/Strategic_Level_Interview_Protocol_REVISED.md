- Use or test any AI system
- Learn new technology
- Change your workflows

**You WILL be asked about:**
- Current collaboration challenges (gaps)
- Ubuntu principles in your work culture
- Whether Ubuntu-driven AI could bridge gaps you experience
- Insights for other IT departments

## SECTION C: UBUNTU-AI BRIDGING ASSESSMENT (10 minutes)
**RQ3: How do stakeholders experience Ubuntu-AI bridging effectiveness?**

**Objective:** Assess whether Ubuntu-driven AI could bridge identified gaps

### **UGENTIC Concept Presentation:**

*"Let me describe a research concept we've developed called UGENTIC - Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence. It's a multi-agent AI system designed to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and organizational operations.*

*The system has six AI agents mirroring your actual IT structure:*
- *IT Manager Agent (strategic coordination)*
- *Service Desk Manager Agent (manages IT Support only - matching your hierarchy)*
- *IT Support Agent (reports to Service Desk Manager)*
- *Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents (report to IT Manager)*

*Each agent embodies Ubuntu principles:*
- ***Interconnectedness:*** Acknowledges how actions affect other departments*
- ***Collective Responsibility:*** Frames solutions as team achievements*
- ***Consultative Decision-Making:*** Seeks input across hierarchy levels*
- ***Transparent Reasoning:*** Explains decisions in accessible language*
- ***Mutual Support:*** Proactively offers help across boundaries*

*This is a research instrument to investigate whether these cultural principles help AI integrate with how you actually work - not a product we're asking you to deploy."*

---

### **C1. Concept Recognition:**
*"Do you recognize the Ubuntu values we described in these agent behaviors?"*

**Probes:**
- Does it sound authentic or performative?
- Would your team recognize this as Ubuntu?
- Does the cultural framing resonate?

### **C2. Gap Bridging Assessment:**
*"Thinking about the collaboration challenges you described earlier, would these Ubuntu-driven agent behaviors help bridge those gaps?"*

**Probes:**
- Would interconnectedness acknowledgment reduce silos?
- Would collective responsibility framing improve teamwork?
- Would consultative approaches respect your workflows?

### **C3. Hierarchical Alignment:**
*"The system respects that Service Desk Manager only manages IT Support, while specialists report to you directly. Does this hierarchical accuracy matter?"*

**Probes:**
- Do current tools get this wrong?
- Would AI respecting real structure improve coordination?
- Does hierarchy matter for effective collaboration?

### **C4. Organizational Fit:**
*"Would this Ubuntu-driven approach align with how your department actually works?"*

**Probes:**
- Does it match your leadership style?
- Would it disrupt or enhance existing workflows?
- Would your team accept AI framed this way?

### **C5. Cultural Authenticity:**
*"Does combining Ubuntu philosophy with AI feel authentic, or does it feel like cultural decoration?"*

**Probes:**
- Is this genuine cultural integration?
- Or superficial appropriation?
- Would South African IT staff embrace this?

### **C6. Trust & Acceptance:**
*"Would you trust AI agents designed with these Ubuntu principles more than generic AI tools?"*

**Probes:**
- Why or why not?
- What would increase trust?
- What concerns remain?
