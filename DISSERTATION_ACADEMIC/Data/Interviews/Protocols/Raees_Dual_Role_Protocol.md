# RAEES BASSIER DUAL-ROLE INTERVIEW PROTOCOL
**Special Protocol Addition for Operational Level Interview**
**Participant:** Raees Bassier (IT Technician + Temporary Infrastructure, October 2025)
**Total Duration:** 60-75 minutes (standard operational + infrastructure section)
**Purpose:** Validate both IT Support and Infrastructure agent designs

---

## PROTOCOL STRUCTURE

**Part 1:** Standard Operational Level Protocol (45 minutes)
- Use `Tactical_Operational_Protocols.md` - Protocol 3
- Focus on IT Technician role

**Part 2:** Infrastructure Perspective (Additional 15-20 minutes)
- Use this special section below
- Focus on temporary Infrastructure experience

---

## PART 2: INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE (RAEES ONLY)

**Transition Statement:**
"Thank you for sharing about your IT Support work. Now I'd like to ask about your experience temporarily covering the Infrastructure role this month. This helps me understand both perspectives."

---

### SECTION A: INFRASTRUCTURE ROLE UNDERSTANDING (5 minutes)

**Objective:** Document Infrastructure responsibilities and workflows

1. **What are the main responsibilities in the Infrastructure role?**
   - *Probe:* Server management? System monitoring? Backups? Updates?

2. **How is the Infrastructure role different from IT Support?**
   - *Probe:* Technical depth? Autonomy? Coordination patterns?

3. **Who do you coordinate with most in the Infrastructure role?**
   - *Probe:* IT Manager? Network? App Support? External vendors?

---

### SECTION B: INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES & WORKFLOWS (8 minutes)

**Objective:** Identify Infrastructure-specific pain points and agent requirements

4. **What are the biggest challenges unique to Infrastructure work?**
   - *Probe:* Proactive vs reactive work? Documentation? Knowledge retention?

5. **Describe a typical Infrastructure task from start to finish.**
   - *Example:* Server maintenance, system update, backup verification
   - *Probe:* Steps involved? Coordination needed? Time required?

6. **When Infrastructure issues arise, how do you currently coordinate with other IT functions?**
   - *Probe:* Communication methods? Escalation processes? Information sharing?

7. **What information do you need quick access to when doing Infrastructure work?**
   - *Probe:* System docs? Configuration details? Change history? Dependencies?

---

### SECTION C: INFRASTRUCTURE AGENT VALIDATION (7 minutes)

**Objective:** Validate Infrastructure agent design from dual perspective

8. **Based on your Infrastructure experience, what would an AI agent need to understand about this role?**
   - *Probe:* Technical knowledge? System relationships? Risk assessment?

9. **What Infrastructure tasks could an AI agent assist with effectively?**
   - *Probe:* Monitoring? Documentation? Routine maintenance? Troubleshooting support?

10. **What Infrastructure decisions must remain with humans?**
    - *Probe:* Critical changes? Security decisions? System architecture?

11. **How could an Infrastructure AI agent support coordination with other IT functions?**
    - *Probe:* Proactive notifications? Impact analysis? Knowledge sharing?

12. **From your perspective working both IT Support and Infrastructure, what's most important for these agents to coordinate on?**
    - *Probe:* Handoffs? Information flow? Escalations?

---

### SECTION D: DUAL PERSPECTIVE SYNTHESIS (3 minutes)

**Objective:** Leverage unique dual viewpoint

13. **Having worked both roles, what coordination improvements would benefit both IT Support and Infrastructure?**

14. **If you could design one feature for AI agents to help both roles work together better, what would it be?**

15. **Is there anything about the Infrastructure role that we haven't discussed but is important for agent design?**

---

## RESEARCH QUESTION MAPPING

**This protocol specifically addresses:**

**RQ1 (Integration Methodology):**
- Q1-7: Infrastructure workflows and coordination patterns
- Q12: Cross-function coordination requirements

**RQ5 (Success Factors & Barriers):**
- Q4: Infrastructure-specific challenges
- Q10: Human judgment boundaries

**Infrastructure Agent Validation:**
- Q8-11: Agent capability requirements
- Q13-14: Coordination improvements

---

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

1. **Infrastructure Role Documentation:**
   - Complete responsibility list
   - Typical workflow examples
   - Coordination patterns

2. **Infrastructure Agent Requirements:**
   - Technical knowledge needs
   - Assistance capabilities
   - Human judgment boundaries

3. **Dual Perspective Insights:**
   - IT Support â†” Infrastructure coordination needs
   - Handoff requirements
   - Information flow optimization

4. **Agent Design Validation:**
   - Confirmation of Infrastructure agent scope
   - Refinement of capabilities
   - Integration requirements with other agents

---

## POST-INTERVIEW NOTES

**Dual Role Observations:**
- Differences in perspective between IT Support and Infrastructure roles:
- Coordination challenges identified from both sides:
- Agent integration insights from dual viewpoint:
- Infrastructure agent validation status:

**Infrastructure-Specific Themes:**
- Critical Infrastructure responsibilities:
- Unique challenges vs IT Support:
- Agent capability boundaries:

---

## THANK YOU

- Thank Raees for providing both perspectives
- Emphasize value of his dual viewpoint for research
- Reiterate confidentiality
- Confirm willingness for any follow-up questions
