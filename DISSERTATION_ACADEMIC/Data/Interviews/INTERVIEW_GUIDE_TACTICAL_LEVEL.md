## SECTION C: UBUNTU-AI BRIDGING CONCEPT (20 minutes)

### **UGENTIC CONCEPT EXPLANATION:**

Let me describe a research concept we've developed called UGENTIC - Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence. It's a multi-agent AI system designed to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and organizational operations.

The system has six AI agents mirroring your actual IT structure:
- **IT Manager Agent** (strategic coordination)
- **Service Desk Manager Agent** (manages IT Support only - your role)
- **IT Support Agent** (reports to Service Desk Manager)
- **Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents** (report to IT Manager)

Each agent embodies Ubuntu principles:
- **Interconnectedness:** Acknowledges how actions affect other departments
- **Collective Responsibility:** Frames solutions as team achievements
- **Consultative Decision-Making:** Seeks input across hierarchy levels
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Explains decisions in accessible language
- **Mutual Support:** Proactively offers help across boundaries

The Service Desk Manager agent would specifically help you coordinate your team and bridge communication with specialists.

---

### **Question 13:**
Does this Ubuntu approach match how you already try to lead your team?

*Probes:*
- Does it sound authentic to you?
- Would your team recognize this as Ubuntu?

---

### **Question 14:**
Could this help with the coordination challenges you mentioned?

*Probes:*
- Escalation handoffs?
- Visibility across teams?
- Workload balancing?

---

### **Question 15:**
What concerns do you have about AI helping coordinate your team?

*Probes:*
- Would it undermine your authority?
- Trust in its decisions?
- Team acceptance?

---

### **Question 16:**
How would you want to interact with a Service Desk Manager AI agent?

*Probes:*
- Dashboard showing team workload?
- Suggestions for task allocation?
- Cross-team coordination support?

---

### **Question 17:**
Would you trust an AI agent to help assign tickets to your team members?

*Probes:*
- What would make you trust or distrust it?
- What would it need to know?

---

### **Question 18:**
How important is it that the AI respects your role as the human manager?

---

### **Question 19:**
Would your team accept Ubuntu-driven AI, or would they see it as more supervision?

---

### **Question 20:**
If this existed, what would success look like from your perspective?

### **Question 23:**
