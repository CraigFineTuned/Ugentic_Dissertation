# INTERVIEW DAY EXECUTION GUIDE
**Created:** October 21, 2025 - Session 32  
**Purpose:** Daily checklist and protocol for flawless interview execution

---

## üéØ DAILY EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY

**Ubuntu Principle Applied:**
> "I am because we are" - Approach each interview as an opportunity to learn from participants, not to validate your system. Their experiences and insights are the research, not your technology.

**Researcher Mindset:**
- **Humility:** You're here to learn, not to teach
- **Presence:** Be fully present with each participant
- **Openness:** Allow unexpected themes to emerge
- **Respect:** Honor participants' time and trust
- **Authenticity:** Be genuine, not performative

**Quality Over Quantity:**
One excellent interview with rich insights > Two rushed interviews with surface-level data

**Standard Opening (Adapt naturally):**

"Thank you so much for participating in this research. I want to start by emphasizing that there are no right or wrong answers - I'm genuinely interested in your authentic experiences and perspectives.

This interview is about understanding your work, how you collaborate with teammates, and your thoughts on technology's role in IT departments. I'm particularly interested in challenges you face and how things could be better.

I'll ask some questions, but feel free to take the conversation in directions that feel important to you. If any question doesn't make sense or feel relevant, just let me know and we can move on.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?"

**Then:**
- [ ] Wait for their response, answer any questions
- [ ] Take a breath, make eye contact, and begin first question

### **Phase 3: Main Interview (35-50 minutes)**

**SECTION A: Ubuntu Understanding & Organizational Context (10-12 min)**

**Opening Questions (Choose based on participant level):**

*Strategic/Tactical:*
- "Can you start by describing your role and responsibilities in the IT department?"
- "How would you characterize the culture and working relationships in your team?"

*Operational:*
- "Walk me through a typical day in your role - what does your work involve?"
- "How do you work with your teammates? What's that relationship like?"

**Ubuntu Exploration:**
- "Have you encountered the concept of Ubuntu before? What does it mean to you?"
- "Thinking about your team, how do values like interconnectedness, mutual support, and collective responsibility show up (or not) in your work?"

**‚úÖ Interview Best Practices:**
- [ ] Listen more than you speak (80/20 rule)
- [ ] Use minimal encouragers: "mm-hmm," "I see," nodding
- [ ] Allow silence - don't rush to fill pauses (participants often continue after 3-5 seconds)
- [ ] Take brief notes (key phrases, themes, surprising statements)
- [ ] Note non-verbal cues: [laughter], [long pause], [thoughtful expression]

**SECTION B: Gap Identification (10-12 min)**

**RQ1 Questions:**
- "What challenges do you face in collaborating with other teams or specialists?"
- "Can you give me a specific example of a time when coordination was difficult?"

- "What would make it easier for you to get help from colleagues or specialists?"
- "Thinking about Ubuntu values - mutual support, collective responsibility - how could those practically show up in IT systems or tools?"

**System Experience (if participant has seen UGENTIC):**
- "What was your experience interacting with the UGENTIC system?"
- "Did it feel different from other technology you've used? How?"
- "Where did it help, and where did it fall short?"

**‚úÖ Managing Depth:**
- [ ] When participant gives rich insight, explore it: "That's really interesting, say more about..."
- [ ] When participant seems unsure, offer concrete examples: "For instance, have you ever..."
- [ ] If answer seems surface-level, probe gently: "Help me understand what that looked like in practice"
- [ ] If topic exhausted, transition smoothly: "That's really helpful. Moving to another area..."

**SECTION D: Transferability & Design Insights (10-12 min)**

**RQ4 Questions:**
- "Based on your experience, what would be most important for any AI system supporting IT work?"
- "What would make technology adoption succeed or fail in an environment like this?"

**‚úÖ Closing the Interview:**
- [ ] Check time discreetly (aim to finish within target 45-60 min)
- [ ] If running over, prioritize remaining RQ-critical questions
