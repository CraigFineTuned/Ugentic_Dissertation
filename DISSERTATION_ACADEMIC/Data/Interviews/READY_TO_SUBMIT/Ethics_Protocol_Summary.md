## 1. STUDY OVERVIEW

### Research Purpose
To investigate the integration of Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI systems into real IT departmental workflows at Sun International GrandWest, validating the UGENTIC framework through mixed-methods research.

### Primary Research Question
Can the gap between real-life departmental operations and AI agent capabilities be practically bridged to improve organizational collaboration, and if so, what methodology enables successful integration?

### Study Design
- **Approach:** Mixed Methods (Qualitative + Quantitative)
- **Design:** Single-site case study
- **Duration:** 2-3 months data collection (October-December 2025)
- **Location:** Sun International GrandWest, Cape Town, South Africa

## 4. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Voluntary Participation
- All participation is entirely voluntary
- No penalties for declining or withdrawing
- Right to skip questions without reason
- Right to withdraw at any time

### Informed Consent
- Written informed consent obtained before any data collection
- Participant Information Sheet provided in advance
- Opportunity to ask questions before consenting
- Copy of consent form provided to participant

### Confidentiality and Anonymity

**Data Anonymization:**
- Each participant assigned a unique code (e.g., ITM01, ITECH03)
- All identifying information removed from transcripts
- Pseudonyms used in all reports and publications
- No quotes attributed to named individuals

**Data Security:**
- **Audio Recordings:** Stored on VeraCrypt-encrypted external hard drive
- **Transcripts:** Stored on encrypted drive and password-protected computer
- **Physical Consent Forms:** Stored in locked filing cabinet in secure home office
- **Coding Key (linking codes to names):** Stored separately from data

**Access Control:**
- Only researcher (Craig Vraagom) and supervisor (Jemini Matiya) have access
- No data shared with Sun International management
- No workplace decision-making based on research data

**Data Retention and Destruction:**
- All data retained for 5 years post-study (until 2030)
- After 5 years: permanent deletion of digital files, shredding of physical documents
- Retention period complies with research standards and allows for publications

### POPIA Compliance

This research fully complies with South Africa's **Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA), Act 4 of 2013**:

**Lawfulness of Processing (Section 9):**
- Data processing based on participant consent
- Processing limited to stated research purpose
- No secondary use without additional consent

**Purpose Specification (Section 13-14):**
- Purpose clearly stated in Participant Information Sheet
- Data collected only for stated research purpose

**Data Minimization (Section 10):**
- Only necessary information collected
- No excessive or irrelevant data gathering

**Information Quality (Section 16):**
- Transcripts verified for accuracy
- Participants can review their own transcripts

**Openness (Section 18):**
- Participants fully informed about data use
- Contact information provided for questions

**Security Safeguards (Section 19):**
- Encryption, locked storage, access controls
- Protection against unauthorized access, loss, or damage

**Data Subject Rights (Sections 23-25):**
- Right to access their own data
- Right to request correction
- Right to request deletion (withdrawal)
- Right to object to processing

### Conflict of Interest Management

**Researcher's Dual Role:**
Craig Vraagom is both the researcher AND a member of the IT Support team at GrandWest. This creates a potential insider bias.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

**1. Reflexivity:**
- Maintain a detailed reflexivity journal documenting:
  - Personal assumptions and biases
  - How insider knowledge may influence interpretation
  - Emotional reactions to data
  - Steps taken to maintain objectivity

**2. Supervisor Oversight:**
- Supervisor (Jemini Matiya) will review:
  - Interview transcripts
  - Analysis process and coding
  - Interpretation of findings
  - Ensures researcher maintains critical distance

**3. Peer Debriefing:**
- Discuss findings with academic peers who are external to the organization
- Challenge interpretations and alternative explanations

**4. Clear Role Separation:**
- Explicitly communicate to participants that research role is separate from colleague role
- Emphasize that participation/responses have no workplace consequences
- Interview in neutral spaces (not at workstations)

**5. Confidentiality Firewall:**
- Research data never discussed in workplace context
- No information shared with management or colleagues
- Researcher maintains strict separation between research and work roles

### Protection from Harm

**Psychological Risks:**
- Minimal risk of discomfort discussing workplace challenges
- Participants can skip questions or stop interview
- Researcher trained to recognize distress signs
- Interview can be paused or terminated at participant request

**Employment Risks:**
- No data shared with Sun International management
- Anonymization prevents identification
- No workplace consequences for participation or responses

**Relationship Risks (dual role):**
- Clear communication that research role is separate
- Confidentiality maintained
- No discussion of research content in workplace

### Vulnerable Populations
- No vulnerable populations targeted
- All participants are adult professionals
- Voluntary consent obtained
