## 1. INVITATION

You are invited to participate in a research study exploring how to better integrate AI agents into real-world IT departments using the African philosophy of Ubuntu. This study is for my Honours dissertation at Richfield University. As you are an IT professional at Sun International GrandWest, your insights are invaluable.

## 2. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

The goal is to understand the current challenges and collaboration methods in your IT department. This information will help validate an AI system (the UGENTIC framework) designed to support your team's work in a way that respects your expertise and fosters collaboration, guided by Ubuntu principles of community and mutual support.

## 3. WHAT IS INVOLVED?

If you agree to participate, you will be asked to:

- **Participate in one interview** about your work, challenges, and team culture:
  - **IT Manager:** 60-75 minutes
  - **Service Desk Manager:** 60-75 minutes
  - **IT Support, Specialists:** 45-60 minutes
  
- **Audio Recording:** With your permission, the interview will be audio-recorded to ensure accuracy. You can request the recording be stopped at any time.

- **Optional Follow-Up Interview:** You may be invited for a brief 30-minute follow-up interview in a few weeks to discuss experiences after the AI system has been tested (completely optional).

## 4. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION

Your participation is **completely voluntary**. You can:
- Refuse to participate without any reason
- Withdraw at any time without penalty
- Skip any questions you don't wish to answer
- Request the interview be stopped at any time

**Your participation (or non-participation) will have NO impact on:**
- Your employment at Sun International GrandWest
- Your working relationship with me (Craig Vraagom)
- Any performance evaluations or workplace decisions

## 5. CONFIDENTIALITY & ANONYMITY

All information you provide will be kept **strictly confidential**:

- **Anonymization:** Your name and any identifying details will be removed from all data. You will be referred to by a code (e.g., "ITM01" for IT Manager 01, "ITECH03" for IT Technician 03).

- **Data Storage:**
  - Audio recordings will be stored on an encrypted external hard drive
  - Transcripts will be anonymized and stored securely
  - Physical consent forms will be stored in a locked filing cabinet
  - Only the researcher (Craig Vraagom) and supervisor (Jemini Matiya) will have access

- **Data Destruction:** All data will be permanently destroyed 5 years after the study is complete (2030).

- **Published Research:** In the final dissertation and any publications, you will be referred to by role only (e.g., "An IT Support Technician stated..." or "The Service Desk Manager explained..."). No quotes will be attributed to you by name.

## 6. RISKS & BENEFITS

**Potential Risks:**
- **Minimal risks** are anticipated
- Some participants may feel mild discomfort discussing workplace challenges
- You can skip any questions that make you uncomfortable
- You can stop the interview at any time

**Potential Benefits:**
- Your insights will directly contribute to creating more human-centered AI for IT operations
- You will be contributing to pioneering research in African AI ethics (Ubuntu philosophy)
- Findings may improve collaboration and workflows in your department
- You will receive a summary of research findings upon completion (if you wish)

## 7. CONFLICT OF INTEREST MANAGEMENT

**Important Disclosure:** I, Craig Vraagom, am both the researcher conducting this study AND a member of the IT Support team at GrandWest. I recognize this dual role and will manage it carefully by:

- **Separating Roles:** This interview is for research purposes only. My role as a researcher is completely separate from my role as a colleague.

- **Confidentiality:** I will treat all your responses with strict research confidentiality. What you share in the interview will not be discussed in the workplace.

- **Objectivity:** I will use a reflexive journal to document and separate my own experiences from yours. My supervisor will review my analysis to ensure objectivity.

- **No Impact on Work Relationship:** Your decision to participate (or not) and anything you share will have absolutely no impact on our working relationship or your employment.

- **Voluntary Participation:** Please feel completely free to decline participation or to withdraw at any time if you feel uncomfortable with the dual role.
