**EMAIL BODY:**

Dear Richfield University Ethics Committee,

I am submitting my ethics application for approval to conduct research for my Honours dissertation.

**Study Details:**
- **Title:** "Bridging Real-World IT Operations with Ubuntu-Driven AI Agents"
- **Student:** Craig Vraagom
- **Student Number:** 40241517
- **Course:** 2025S2RPR800D_Research_Project
- **Supervisor:** Jemini Matiya
- **Degree:** Honours in Research Project

**Research Overview:**

This mixed-methods case study will investigate the integration of Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI systems into real IT departmental workflows at Sun International GrandWest. The research involves 16-18 semi-structured interviews with IT department staff across strategic, tactical, and operational levels to validate the UGENTIC framework.

The study combines:
- **Qualitative:** Semi-structured interviews (45-75 minutes each) and thematic analysis
- **Quantitative:** Performance metrics comparison (pre/post system testing)
- **Cultural Dimension:** Integration of Ubuntu philosophy in AI system design

**Ethical Considerations:**

I have carefully considered all ethical dimensions of this research:

1. **Voluntary Participation:** All participation is entirely voluntary with no penalties for declining or withdrawing

2. **Informed Consent:** Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants using the attached consent form

3. **Confidentiality:** All participants will be anonymized using codes (e.g., ITM01). Data will be stored securely on encrypted drives and in locked cabinets

4. **POPIA Compliance:** The research fully complies with South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act (2013)

5. **Dual Role Management:** I acknowledge that as a member of the IT team, I have an insider position. I will manage this through reflexivity journaling, supervisor oversight, and clear role separation

6. **Minimal Risk:** The research poses minimal risk to participants (mild discomfort discussing workplace challenges). Participants can skip questions or withdraw at any time

**Attached Documents:**
1. Participant Information Sheet (detailed study information)
2. Informed Consent Form (consent documentation)
3. Research Ethics Protocol Summary (comprehensive ethics protocol)
4. Interview Protocols (Strategic, Tactical, and Operational level guides)
5. Research Proposal (full study design and methodology)

**Timeline Request:**

Given the dissertation deadline of December 5, 2025, I respectfully request expedited review if possible. I am committed to beginning data collection in mid-October 2025, pending ethics approval.

I am available to:
- Provide any additional information or documentation
- Make revisions as needed

## EMAIL 2: ORGANIZATIONAL APPROVAL REQUEST (IT MANAGER)

**To:** [Sewrathan's Email - IT Manager at GrandWest]  
**Subject:** Research Study Request - IT Department Collaboration Study  
**Attachment:** Participant_Information_Sheet.pdf

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

Dear Sewrathan,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to formally request permission to conduct a research study within our IT department as part of my Honours dissertation at Richfield University. I wanted to provide you with full details and seek your approval.

**Study Purpose:**

I am researching how to improve collaboration and workflows in IT departments using AI support systems guided by Ubuntu principles (African philosophy of community and mutual support). The goal is to validate the UGENTIC framework - a system designed to support our team's work without replacing human expertise.

**What This Involves:**

**Interviews:** 16-18 confidential interviews with IT staff across all levels:
- IT Manager (you): 60-75 minutes
- Service Desk Manager: 60-75 minutes  
- IT Support, Infrastructure, App Support staff: 45-60 minutes each

**Key Points:**
- All participation is **completely voluntary** - staff can decline without any consequences
- All data will be **fully anonymized** - no individual identification in any reports
- **No disruption to operations** - interviews scheduled during quiet periods or outside work hours at participants' preference
- **Strict confidentiality** - research data will not be shared with management or influence any workplace decisions
- **Ethics approval** - submitted to Richfield University Ethics Committee today

**Benefits:**

- **For the IT Department:** May reveal insights to improve our workflows and collaboration
- **For Sun International:** Positions GrandWest as a leader in innovative IT practices
- **For Research:** Contributes to developing more human-centered, culturally-grounded AI systems
- **For South Africa:** Advances African approaches to AI development

**Confidentiality Assurance:**

I want to emphasize that:
- This is academic research, not a workplace assessment
- Individual responses will never be shared with you or any management
- Findings will be reported in aggregate only
- The research is separate from my work role

**Next Steps:**

If you approve this request:
1. I will wait for Richfield Ethics Committee approval (submitted today)
2. I will then approach staff individually with invitations to participate
3. Interviews would take place in October-November 2025
4. I can provide you with a summary of aggregate findings upon completion (optional)

**Your Approval:**

Would you be willing to grant permission for this research to proceed? I have attached the full Participant Information Sheet with complete study details.

I am happy to:
- Meet with you to discuss any concerns or questions
- Provide additional information
- Modify the approach if you have specific requirements

**Contact:**
- Email: [YOUR EMAIL]
- Phone: [YOUR PHONE]
- Available for meeting at your convenience

Thank you for considering this request. Your support would be greatly appreciated and would contribute to groundbreaking research in AI and organizational collaboration.

**Best regards,**

## EMAIL 3: SUPERVISOR PROGRESS UPDATE

**To:** [Jemini Matiya's Email]  
**Subject:** Progress Update - Ethics Submission Complete & 10-Week Plan Activated  
**Attachment (Optional):** 10_Week_Execution_Plan.pdf

---

**EMAIL BODY:**

Dear Jemini,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to update you on my dissertation progress and the actions I've taken today.

**Critical Timeline Discovery:**

I have identified that I have only **9.5 weeks remaining** until the December 5, 2025 deadline (not the 10 months I had been assuming from an older roadmap). This required immediate emergency planning, which I completed today.

**Actions Completed Today (September 30, 2025):**

✅ **Ethics Application Submitted** to Richfield University Ethics Committee  
✅ **Organizational Approval Requested** from IT Manager (Sewrathan)  
✅ **10-Week Emergency Execution Plan Created** with week-by-week deliverables  
✅ **Chapter 1 (Introduction) Writing Begun** - target 3 pages today  

**Ethics Documents Submitted:**
1. Participant Information Sheet (comprehensive study details)
2. Informed Consent Form (POPIA-compliant)
3. Research Ethics Protocol Summary (full ethical considerations)
4. Interview Protocols (Strategic, Tactical, Operational levels)
5. Research Proposal (updated operational status)

**Target Sample:** 16-18 IT department staff across 6 roles and 3 organizational levels

**10-Week Compressed Timeline:**

Given the urgent deadline, I have created a realistic execution plan:

**Weeks 1-2 (Sep 30 - Oct 13):** Ethics approval + Write Chapters 1-3 (Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology)

**Weeks 3-5 (Oct 14 - Nov 3):** Conduct all 16-18 interviews + Complete Chapters 4-5

**Week 6 (Nov 4-10):** Complete data analysis (qualitative + quantitative) + Finalize Chapter 5 (Results)

**Week 7 (Nov 11-17):** Write Chapters 6-7 (Discussion, Conclusion) + Abstract

**Weeks 8-9 (Nov 18 - Dec 1):** Integration, proofreading, Richfield compliance verification

**Week 10 (Dec 2-5):** Final review, printing, **SUBMISSION**

**Parallel Workstream Strategy:**

I have identified that Chapters 1-4 (approximately 60% of dissertation) can be written WITHOUT waiting for interview data. This allows me to make significant progress while the ethics approval processes.

**Current Status:**

- **Completion:** 65% (UGENTIC system operational, 56 literature sources complete, protocols ready)
- **Ethics:** Submitted today, awaiting approval
- **Organizational Approval:** Requested today from Sewrathan
- **Writing:** Chapter 1 begun today (target 3 pages)

**Request for Support:**

Given the tight timeline, I would greatly appreciate your support in:

1. **Ethics Review Expediting:** If possible, any assistance in expediting the ethics review would be extremely helpful given the December 5 deadline

2. **Weekly Check-Ins:** Brief weekly email updates to maintain accountability and momentum

3. **Chapter Review:** As chapters are completed, I will send them to you for feedback (understanding this may be quick turnaround due to timeline)

**Risk Management:**

I have identified and planned for potential risks:
- **Ethics delay:** Parallel writing strategy + reduced sample size backup plan (12-14 participants minimum)
- **Interview scheduling:** Early recruitment + flexible timing
- **Analysis time:** Simplified coding approach + focused on 5-7 major themes
- **Writing paralysis:** Daily word count targets + "draft first, perfect later" approach

**Confidence Level:**

Despite the compressed timeline, I am confident this is achievable because:
- System is operational (proof of concept complete)
- Literature review is complete (56 sources)
- Methodology is validated (through implementation)
- I have a detailed, realistic plan
- I am committed to 4-6 hours focused daily work

**My Commitment:**

I am fully committed to:
- Following the 10-week plan rigorously
- Working 4-6 hours daily on dissertation
- Meeting all ethical standards
- Producing high-quality research
- Communicating proactively with you
- Submitting on December 5, 2025

**Questions or Concerns:**

Do you have any concerns about this timeline or approach? Are there any adjustments you would recommend? I am open to your guidance and feedback.

I will provide weekly progress updates every Monday moving forward. My next update will be October 7, 2025 with:
- Ethics approval status
- Organizational approval status
- Chapter 1 completion
- Chapter 2 & 3 progress

Thank you for your continued support and guidance. I greatly appreciate your mentorship through this intensive final phase.

**Best regards,**
