## INFRASTRUCTURE AGENT VALIDATION APPROACH

**Challenge:** Infrastructure role in transition
- Former permanent: Luyolo (left for Head Office)
- Current temporary: Raees Bassier (October 2025)
- Former temporary: Craig Vraagom (July 2025) - researcher, cannot interview self

**Solution:** Dual validation approach
1. **Raees Bassier:** Current temp Infrastructure + IT Tech perspective (dual insight)
2. **Luyolo Mngcita:** Former permanent Infrastructure perspective (validates agent design)

**Methodological Strength:** Two different Infrastructure perspectives (temporary + permanent) provide comprehensive validation of Infrastructure agent design despite role transition.
