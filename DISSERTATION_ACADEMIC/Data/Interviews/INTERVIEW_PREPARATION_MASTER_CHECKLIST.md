- **Mitigation:** Strong rapport building, clear ethical communication, right to skip questions
- **Response:** Pause immediately, respect withdrawal, thank them for time given

### **Risk 5: Time Overruns**
- **Mitigation:** Practice time management in pilot, use protocol section time targets
- **Response:** Politely redirect, prioritize RQ-critical questions, offer follow-up if needed

### **Risk 6: Researcher Fatigue**
- **Mitigation:** 2 interviews/day maximum, self-care between interviews, buffer days
