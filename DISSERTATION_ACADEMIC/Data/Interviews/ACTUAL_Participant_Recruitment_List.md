## üö® **CRITICAL RESEARCH FINDING: INFRASTRUCTURE ROLE GAP**

### **UGENTIC Framework Has 6 Agents, But GrandWest Has Only 5 Roles:**

| UGENTIC Agent | Actual GrandWest Role | Status |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| IT Manager | Sewrathan (ITM) | ‚úÖ EXISTS |
| Service Desk Manager | Buziek (ITSDM) | ‚úÖ EXISTS |
| IT Support | 6 IT Techs | ‚úÖ EXISTS |
| App Support | Monageng (ITASE) | ‚úÖ EXISTS |
| Network Support | Buekes (ITISE) | ‚úÖ EXISTS |
| **Infrastructure** | ??? | ‚ùå **NO DEDICATED ROLE** |

### **Infrastructure Responsibilities Currently:**
- Craig (researcher) covered infrastructure temporarily (July 2025)
- Luyolo Mngcita previously held this role (now at Head Office)
- Responsibilities may be distributed or handled by Network/App Support

### **Research Implication:**
This is a **VALUABLE RESEARCH FINDING** demonstrating:
1. Real organizational structures don't always match idealized agent models
2. Need to map actual vs. theoretical structures before AI implementation
3. Interview questions should explore: "Who handles infrastructure tasks now?"
4. Framework must be flexible to adapt to actual organizational realities

**In your dissertation:**
- Note the gap in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4)
- Explore through interviews how infrastructure work is distributed
- Discuss in Chapter 6 (Discussion) as organizational mapping finding
- Recommend organizational structure analysis as prerequisite step

## üí° **RECRUITMENT TIPS**

**Do:**
- ‚úÖ Start with Jaap, Matika, or Peffer (colleagues you know well)
- ‚úÖ Personal conversation before formal email
- ‚úÖ Emphasize 45-minute commitment (not long)
- ‚úÖ Offer coffee/lunch during interview
- ‚úÖ Be flexible with scheduling
- ‚úÖ Thank participants genuinely

**Don't:**
- ‚ùå Pressure anyone to participate
- ‚ùå Interview during crisis/busy periods
- ‚ùå Promise individual benefits
- ‚ùå Discuss others' responses
- ‚ùå Schedule more than 3-4 interviews per day

---

## üö® **SPECIAL NOTE: INFRASTRUCTURE ROLE QUESTIONS**

**In EVERY interview, include these questions:**

1. "Who currently handles infrastructure tasks like server management, backups, and system maintenance?"
2. "Has this changed since Luyolo left for Head Office?"
3. "How are infrastructure responsibilities distributed in the team?"
4. "Do you ever handle infrastructure tasks, even if it's not your primary role?"

**This will reveal:**
- How infrastructure work is actually distributed
- Whether it's a gap or intentionally distributed
- How the team adapted after Luyolo's departure
- Whether UGENTIC needs an Infrastructure agent or if responsibilities are emergent
