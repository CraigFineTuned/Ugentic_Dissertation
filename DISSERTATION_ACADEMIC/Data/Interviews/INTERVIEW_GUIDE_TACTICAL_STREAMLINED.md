## THE 8 QUESTIONS

### **QUESTION 1: Ubuntu Understanding**
**"How would you describe Ubuntu in your own words?"**

*(If unfamiliar: "Ubuntu is an African philosophy - 'umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu' - a person is a person through other people. It's about collective humanity and community.")*

*Follow naturally with:*
- As Service Desk Manager, do you see yourself serving the team or directing them?
- How do you approach leadership?

---

### **QUESTION 2: Coordination Challenges**
**"What are your biggest challenges coordinating between your IT Support team and the specialist teams?"**

*Let them talk, then follow up with:*
- Can you walk me through what happens when a ticket needs escalation?
- Where do things break down?
- What information do you wish you had?

---

### **QUESTION 3: Team Success & Responsibility**
**"When your team successfully resolves a complex issue, how do you think about that success?"**

*Listen for individual vs. collective:*
- Is it one person's win or the team's?
- When something goes wrong, how does the team handle responsibility?

---

### **QUESTION 4: UGENTIC Concept Introduction**

**Explain the concept:**

"Let me describe UGENTIC - a research concept with six AI agents mirroring your IT structure:
- IT Manager Agent, Service Desk Manager Agent (your role), IT Support Agent
- Application, Network, and Infrastructure Agents

Each agent embodies Ubuntu principles:
- Interconnectedness (understanding impacts on others)
- Collective Responsibility (team solutions, not blame)
- Consultative Decision-Making (seeking input)
- Transparent Reasoning (explaining decisions clearly)
- Mutual Support (proactive help across boundaries)

The Service Desk Manager agent would help you coordinate your team and bridge communication with specialists."

**Then ask:** **"Does this match how you already try to lead, or is it different?"**

*Let them respond honestly, then:*
- Could this help with the coordination challenges you mentioned?
- What concerns do you have about AI helping coordinate your team?

---

### **QUESTION 5: Authority & Trust**
**"Would AI coordinating work undermine your authority or support it?"**

*Follow their lead:*
- What would make you trust it?
- How would you want to interact with it?
- Would your team accept it?

---

### **QUESTION 6: Ubuntu Authenticity**
**"Does this Ubuntu approach sound authentic to you, or does it sound performative?"**

*This gets at cultural legitimacy:*
- Would your team recognize this as Ubuntu?
- Does the cultural framing matter?

---

### **QUESTION 7: Advice for Other Coordinators**
**"If another Service Desk Manager was considering this, what would you tell them?"**

*This captures practical wisdom:*
- What would make it succeed or fail?
- What needs to be in place?

---

### **QUESTION 8: Anything Else?**
**"Is there anything about team coordination, Ubuntu leadership, or AI that we haven't discussed but you think is important?"**

*Give them space to share what's on their mind.*
