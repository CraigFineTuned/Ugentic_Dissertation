## QUESTION 4: Research Artifact â€“ UGENTIC System

**BACKGROUND:**

As part of my Honours research, I designed and built a prototype multi-agent AI system called **UGENTIC** (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence). This is a **research artifact** - not a commercial product - created to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT department operations.

**The prototype has six AI agents mirroring the IT department structure:**
- IT Manager Agent
- Service Desk Manager Agent
- IT Support Agent
- Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents

**Each agent is designed to embody Ubuntu principles:**
- Help each other across teams
- Share solutions, not blame
- Ask for input, not just command
- Explain clearly what they're doing

**This research investigates WHETHER this Ubuntu-driven approach can address collaboration gaps in IT departments. Your perspective helps validate or challenge this design concept.**

---

**Based on your experience with IT collaboration challenges:**

**Does this Ubuntu-driven design approach sound like it could help, or does it sound impractical?**

**Your answer:**

## QUESTION 5: Trust & Authority

## QUESTION 6: Cultural vs. Technical
