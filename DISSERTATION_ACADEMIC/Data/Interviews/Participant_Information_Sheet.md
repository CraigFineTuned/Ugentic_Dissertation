## RESEARCH PURPOSE

**Research Question:**  
How can Ubuntu philosophy enhance collaboration in multi-agent AI systems within IT departments?

**Background:**  
Multi-agent AI systems coordinate multiple intelligent agents to solve complex problems. However, these systems often lack cultural coherence with organizational values. This research explores whether integrating Ubuntu principles (collective responsibility, mutual support, interconnectedness) into AI agent behaviors improves collaboration quality and cultural alignment.

**The UGENTIC System:**  
I have developed UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Departmental Collective Intelligence)—a six-agent AI system designed for GrandWest Casino's IT department, explicitly incorporating Ubuntu philosophy into agent prompts, knowledge bases, and interaction protocols.

**Research Goal:**  
Understand IT staff experiences with, and perceptions of, Ubuntu-enhanced AI collaboration compared to traditional approaches.
