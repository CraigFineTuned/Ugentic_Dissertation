## THE 6 QUESTIONS

### **QUESTION 1: Ubuntu in Your Own Words**
**"How would you describe Ubuntu in your own words?"**

*(If unfamiliar: "Ubuntu is an African philosophy - 'umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu' - a person is a person through other people. We become who we are through community.")*

*Follow naturally with:*
- Do you see that in how the IT team works together?
- Do teammates help each other when someone's stuck?

---

### **QUESTION 2: Daily Frustrations**
**"What frustrates you most about collaboration in IT - like getting information you need or coordinating with other teams?"**

*Let them vent, then:*
- Can you give me a specific example?
- What would make your daily work easier?

---

### **QUESTION 3: When Things Go Wrong**
**"When there's an incident or problem, how does the team handle it?"**

*Listen for blame vs. support:*
- Is it "whose fault?" or "how do we fix it?"
- Do people help each other or point fingers?

---

### **QUESTION 4: UGENTIC Concept Introduction**

**Explain simply:**

"Let me describe something we built called UGENTIC. It's AI agents that mirror the IT structure:
- IT Manager Agent, Service Desk Manager Agent, IT Support Agent
- Application, Network, and Infrastructure Agents

They're designed with Ubuntu principles:
- Help each other across teams
- Share solutions, not blame
- Ask for input, not just command
- Explain clearly what they're doing

The idea is to see if AI with Ubuntu values can actually help with the collaboration problems we face."

**Then ask:** **"Does that sound helpful or just like more technology to deal with?"**

*Let them be honest:*
- Could this help with the frustrations you mentioned?
- What concerns do you have?
- Would you actually use it?

---

### **QUESTION 5: Trust & Usefulness**
**"What would make you trust it versus ignore it or not trust it?"**

*Follow their thinking:*
- How would you want to interact with it? (Chat? Dashboard?)
- Would it respect your expertise or talk down to you?

---

### **QUESTION 6: Anything Else?**
**"Anything about IT work, team collaboration, or AI that we haven't talked about but you think I should know?"**

*Give them space to share freely.*
