## SECTION C: UBUNTU-AI CONCEPT (15 minutes)

### **UGENTIC CONCEPT EXPLANATION:**

Let me describe a research concept we've developed called UGENTIC - Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence. It's a multi-agent AI system designed to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and organizational operations.

The system has six AI agents mirroring your actual IT structure:
- **IT Manager Agent** (strategic coordination)
- **Service Desk Manager Agent** (manages IT Support only)
- **IT Support Agent** (reports to Service Desk Manager)
- **Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents** (report to IT Manager)

Each agent embodies Ubuntu principles:
- **Interconnectedness:** Acknowledges how actions affect other departments
- **Collective Responsibility:** Frames solutions as team achievements
- **Consultative Decision-Making:** Seeks input across hierarchy levels
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Explains decisions in accessible language
- **Mutual Support:** Proactively offers help across boundaries

The agents could help you get information faster, coordinate with other teams, and share knowledge.

---

### **Question 13:**
Does this Ubuntu approach sound like how your team already works, or is it different?

*Probes:*
- Would your teammates recognize this as Ubuntu?
- Does it sound authentic or fake?

---

### **Question 14:**
Could this help with the challenges you mentioned earlier?

*Probes:*
- Getting information faster?
- Better coordination with other teams?
- Access to specialist knowledge?

---

### **Question 15:**
What concerns do you have about AI being involved in your daily work?

*Probes:*
- Would it slow you down?
- Would you trust it?
- Would it feel like more supervision?

---

### **Question 16:**
How would you want to interact with an AI agent?

*Probes:*
- Chat (like asking a colleague)?
- Dashboard (seeing information)?
- Email/notifications?
- Something else?

---

### **Question 17:**
What would make you trust an AI agent versus not trust it?

*Probes:*
- Accurate information?
- Clear explanations?
- Respecting your expertise?

---

### **Question 18:**
Would you want AI to help you, give you suggestions, or make decisions for you?

---

### **Question 19:**
How important is it that the AI understands and respects Ubuntu values versus just being technically smart?

### **Question 23:**

What's unique about working in IT at GrandWest versus what you think is the same everywhere?
