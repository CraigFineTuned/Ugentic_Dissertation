## SECTION C: UBUNTU-AI BRIDGING CONCEPT (20 minutes)

### **UGENTIC CONCEPT EXPLANATION:**

Let me describe a research concept we've developed called UGENTIC - Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence. It's a multi-agent AI system designed to investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can bridge the gap between AI capabilities and organizational operations.

The system has six AI agents mirroring your actual IT structure:
- **IT Manager Agent** (strategic coordination)
- **Service Desk Manager Agent** (manages IT Support only)
- **IT Support Agent** (reports to Service Desk Manager)
- **Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure Agents** (report to IT Manager)

Each agent embodies Ubuntu principles:
- **Interconnectedness:** Acknowledges how actions affect other departments
- **Collective Responsibility:** Frames solutions as team achievements
- **Consultative Decision-Making:** Seeks input across hierarchy levels
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Explains decisions in accessible language
- **Mutual Support:** Proactively offers help across boundaries

This is a research instrument to investigate whether these cultural principles help AI integrate with how you actually work.

---

### **Question 13:**
Do you recognize the Ubuntu values we described in these agent behaviors?

*Probes:*
- Does it sound authentic or performative?
- Would your team recognize this as Ubuntu?

---

### **Question 14:**
Could this approach address the collaboration challenges you mentioned earlier?

*Probes:*
- Which gaps could it help with?
- Which gaps would it not address?

---

### **Question 15:**
What concerns do you have about Ubuntu-driven AI in your department?

- Strategic recommendations?
- Cross-team coordination support?

---

### **Question 17:**
What would make you trust or distrust this system?

*Probes:*

- Respect for your authority?

---

### **Question 18:**

---

### **Question 19:**
How important is it that the AI embodies cultural values like Ubuntu versus just being technically efficient?

### **Question 23:**
