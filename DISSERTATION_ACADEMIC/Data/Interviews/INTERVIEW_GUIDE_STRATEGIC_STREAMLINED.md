## THE 8 QUESTIONS

### **QUESTION 1: Ubuntu Understanding**
**"How would you describe Ubuntu in your own words?"**

*(If unfamiliar: "Ubuntu is an African philosophy - 'umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu' - a person is a person through other people. It's about collective humanity and community.")*

*Follow naturally with:*
- Where do you see those values in your IT department?
- How does that show up in how decisions are made?

---

### **QUESTION 2: Current Collaboration Challenges**
**"What are the biggest challenges your IT department faces with collaboration across teams?"**

*Let them talk, then follow up with:*
- Can you give me a specific example?
- Where do delays or breakdowns usually happen?
- What would make collaboration easier?

---

### **QUESTION 3: Current Tools & Gaps**
**"Do your current IT management tools understand how your department actually works?"**

*Listen for what's missing, then:*
- What do they miss about relationships between teams?
- How well do they handle your organizational hierarchy?
- What would you change about them?

### **QUESTION 4: UGENTIC Concept Introduction**

**Explain the concept:**

"Let me describe UGENTIC - a research concept with six AI agents mirroring your IT structure:
- IT Manager Agent, Service Desk Manager Agent, IT Support Agent
- Application, Network, and Infrastructure Agents

Each agent embodies Ubuntu principles:
- Interconnectedness (understanding impacts on others)
- Collective Responsibility (team solutions, not blame)
- Consultative Decision-Making (seeking input)
- Transparent Reasoning (explaining decisions clearly)
- Mutual Support (proactive help across boundaries)

This is a research instrument to investigate whether Ubuntu principles help AI integrate with how you actually work."

**Then ask:** **"Does this approach sound authentic, or does it sound like we're just putting a cultural label on technology?"**

*Let them respond honestly, then:*
- Do you recognize Ubuntu in those behaviors?
- Could this address the challenges you mentioned?
- What concerns do you have?

---

### **QUESTION 5: Trust & Authority**
**"As IT Manager, what would make you trust or distrust a system like this?"**

*Follow their lead:*
- Would it respect your decision-making authority?
- How would you want to interact with it?
- What would cross the line?

---

### **QUESTION 6: Cultural vs. Technical**
**"How important is it that AI embodies cultural values like Ubuntu versus just being technically efficient?"**

*This gets at whether the Ubuntu framing matters:*
- Does culture make a difference in technology adoption?
- Would your team respond differently?

---

### **QUESTION 7: Advice for Others**
**"If another IT Manager was considering this, what's the most important thing they should know?"**

*This captures transferability:*
- What would make it succeed or fail?
- What's unique to GrandWest vs. universal?

---

### **QUESTION 8: Anything Else?**
**"Is there anything about IT collaboration, Ubuntu, or AI that we haven't discussed but you think is important?"**

*Give them space to share what's on their mind.*
