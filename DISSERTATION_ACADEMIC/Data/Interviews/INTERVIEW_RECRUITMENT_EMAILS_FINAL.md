Dear [Service Desk Manager Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out to invite you to participate in my Honours research at Richfield University. I'm investigating how Ubuntu philosophy can help bridge the gap between AI technology and real IT department operations, focusing on Sun International GrandWest as my case study.

**Why Your Perspective is Crucial:**

As the Service Desk Manager, you occupy a unique position - translating strategic direction into operational reality while coordinating front-line technical work. Your experience with team coordination, workload balancing, and facilitating collaboration across specializations is essential to understanding whether Ubuntu-driven AI can effectively support organizational operations.

**What I'm Asking:**

- **Time Commitment:** Approximately 60 minutes
- **Format:** Conversational interview - I'll ask about your experiences, you share your insights
- **When:** November 17-23, 2025 (we'll find a time that works for you)
- **Where:** [Your preference - GrandWest meeting room, your office, or another location]
- **What We'll Discuss:** 
  - Your approach to coordinating IT service delivery
  - Challenges you face in facilitating team collaboration
  - Your perspective on how AI could (or couldn't) support your work
  - What makes technology adoption succeed or fail in organizational contexts

**Your Rights & Protections:**

Your tactical leadership perspective - balancing competing demands, enabling team success, translating strategy into action - is exactly what this research needs to understand how AI can authentically support (rather than disrupt) organizational realities.

I'd be grateful for your participation and look forward to learning from your experience.

**Interested?**

Just reply with a few times that work for you during Nov 17-23, and I'll confirm a slot.

**CC:** Jemini Matiya <jemini.matiya@richfield.ac.za>  
**From:** Craig Vraagom <40241517@student.richfield.ac.za>

Hi Raees,

I'm reaching out to invite you to participate in my Honours research at Richfield University. Given your unique position - current infrastructure role plus your previous management experience - your perspective would be particularly valuable.

**Research Focus:**

I'm investigating how Ubuntu philosophy can bridge gaps between AI capabilities and real IT departmental operations, using GrandWest as a case study.

**Why Your Dual Perspective Matters:**

You bring a rare combination:
1. **Technical Infrastructure Expertise:** Current hands-on work with servers, systems, and infrastructure operations
2. **Management Experience:** Previous leadership roles give you strategic insight into organizational challenges
3. **Organizational Context:** Deep understanding of GrandWest's IT structure and evolution

This dual lens - operational reality + strategic awareness - is exactly what I need to validate whether Ubuntu-driven AI can effectively bridge both technical and organizational dimensions.

**What Participation Involves:**

- **Duration:** Approximately 60 minutes (slightly longer to capture your dual perspective)
- **Format:** Semi-structured interview covering both technical and management viewpoints
- **Timing:** November 17-23, 2025 (flexible scheduling around your infrastructure responsibilities)
- **Location:** Private GrandWest meeting room (or your preference)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Infrastructure operations and cross-team dependencies
  - Your management experience and organizational insights
  - How technical and strategic perspectives inform each other
  - Your assessment of AI's potential in bridging operational gaps

**Ethical Assurances:**

- ✅ Full ethics approval (BSCH202588)
- ✅ Complete anonymity in publications
- ✅ Voluntary participation with right to withdraw
- ✅ Confidential handling of all data

**Attached:**

1. **Participant Information Sheet** - Comprehensive research details
2. **Informed Consent Form** - Your protections documented

**Next Steps:**

If you're willing to participate:
1. Review the attached documents
2. Reply with 2-3 preferred interview times (Nov 17-23)
3. Let me know if you have any questions

Your unique position offers insights that neither purely operational nor purely strategic participants can provide. This dual perspective is critical for understanding how AI can authentically integrate across organizational levels.

I'd be honored to include your voice in this research.

Thanks for considering,

## 📧 EMAIL TEMPLATE 6: LUYOLO MNGCITA (External Validation)

**Subject:** Research Invitation: External Validation Perspective (Former Infrastructure, Now Head Office)

**To:** Luyolo Mngcita <[email]>  
**CC:** Jemini Matiya <jemini.matiya@richfield.ac.za>  
**From:** Craig Vraagom <40241517@student.richfield.ac.za>

Hi Luyolo,

I hope you're enjoying your new role at Head Office!

I'm conducting Honours research at Richfield University on Ubuntu philosophy and AI in IT departments. I'm focusing on GrandWest as my case study, and I'd love to include your unique external validation perspective.

**Why Your Perspective is Valuable:**

You offer something rare:
1. **Intimate GrandWest Knowledge:** You worked infrastructure at GrandWest, so you know the department, culture, and challenges deeply
2. **External Position:** Now at Head Office, you have distance to provide comparative insights
3. **Organizational Context:** You can speak to both what's unique about GrandWest and what's typical across Sun International properties

This external-but-informed perspective is perfect for validation - helping me understand what's context-specific vs. what might generalize to other IT departments.

**What I'm Asking:**

- **Time:** About 45 minutes
- **Format:** Conversational interview about your GrandWest experience and comparative observations
- **When:** November 17-23, 2025 (we can work around your Head Office schedule)
- **Where:** [Your preference - Head Office, GrandWest if you're visiting, video call, or other]
- **Topics:**
  - Your experience with infrastructure operations at GrandWest
  - How GrandWest IT compares to other Sun International properties
  - Collaboration patterns you observed
  - What you think would/wouldn't transfer to other IT contexts

**Ethical Protections:**

- ✅ Full Richfield ethics approval (BSCH202588)
- ✅ Complete anonymity - you won't be identifiable in publications
- ✅ Voluntary - withdraw anytime
- ✅ Confidential - only I will know your specific comments

**Attached:**

- Participant Information Sheet
- Informed Consent Form

**Interested?**

Just reply with a few times that work (Nov 17-23), and we'll schedule something convenient for you - I'm happy to come to Head Office, meet at GrandWest, or do this via video call if that's easier.

Your external validation perspective - the ability to say "yes, that's unique to GrandWest" or "no, I see that pattern elsewhere too" - is exactly what rigorous case study research needs.

Thanks for considering!

Best,
