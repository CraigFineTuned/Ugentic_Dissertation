## 1. Abstract

A persistent gap exists between AI agent capabilities and real-world organizational IT operations, preventing effective collaboration enhancement. AI systems typically ignore organizational hierarchies, lack cultural coherence with collaborative values, and fail to integrate with authentic departmental workflows. This research investigates whether Ubuntu philosophy—with its emphasis on collective humanity, interconnectedness, and communal responsibility—can effectively bridge this AI-organizational gap.

Using Design Science Research methodology, this study develops UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence) as a research instrument: a six-agent multi-agent system mirroring Sun International GrandWest's actual IT department structure (IT Manager, Service Desk Manager, IT Support, Application Support, Network Support, Infrastructure). The system operationalizes Ubuntu principles through agent behaviors and coordination mechanisms, enabling empirical investigation of whether cultural philosophy can bridge technical-organizational gaps.

The research employs mixed methods validation through semi-structured interviews with 10-14 IT department stakeholders across strategic, tactical, and operational levels, analyzed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2024). Four research questions guide the investigation: (RQ1) What specific gaps exist between AI capabilities and real IT workflows? (RQ2) How can Ubuntu principles be operationalized to address these gaps? (RQ3) How do stakeholders experience Ubuntu-AI bridging effectiveness? (RQ4) What design principles emerge for transferability?

This represents the first empirical validation of Ubuntu philosophy as a bridging mechanism between AI capabilities and organizational operations. Expected outcomes include stakeholder-validated evidence of Ubuntu's effectiveness (or limitations) in bridging AI-organizational gaps, design principles for culturally-grounded AI integration, and transferable insights for other IT departments facing similar collaboration challenges.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 The AI-Organizational Gap

Organizations worldwide face a critical challenge: AI systems possess sophisticated capabilities yet consistently fail to integrate effectively with real organizational operations. Recent empirical evidence reveals the severity of this gap. The Upwork Research Institute (2024) surveyed 2,500 global workers and found that 77% using AI report it has *increased* their workload rather than reducing it, with 47% uncertain how to achieve expected productivity gains. Gallup's (2024) survey of 21,543 working adults revealed that only 15% report their organization has communicated a clear AI integration plan or strategy. This disconnect between AI capabilities and actual work practices creates productivity barriers rather than enhancements.

Three dimensions characterize this gap:

**Technical Gap:** AI systems ignore organizational hierarchies, disrupt established workflows, and fail to respect departmental coordination patterns (Davenport & Ronanki, 2021; Bean, 2025). Multi-agent AI architectures demonstrate sophisticated coordination capabilities (Moore, 2025; Krishnan, 2025), yet these technical capabilities remain disconnected from how real IT departments actually function.

**Cultural Gap:** AI systems optimize individual agent performance rather than collective organizational goals, embedding Western individualistic assumptions that conflict with collaborative organizational cultures (Mhlambi, 2020; Gwagwa et al., 2022). Organizations require AI that enhances team collaboration, yet current systems lack cultural frameworks for collective coordination.

**Collaboration Gap:** Departmental silos impede cross-functional collaboration and decision-making (Kanter, 2020), yet AI implementations often reinforce rather than bridge these silos. Organizations need AI systems that facilitate rather than hinder cross-departmental coordination.

### 2.2 Ubuntu Philosophy as Potential Bridge

Ubuntu philosophy—rooted in the foundational principle "I am because we are" (*umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu*)—offers a potential bridging mechanism. Ubuntu emphasizes collective humanity where individual identity emerges through community relationships, interconnectedness where actions affect the collective, collective responsibility for organizational outcomes, and communal decision-making respecting diverse perspectives (Mhlambi, 2020; Mkhize, 2022; Odero et al., 2024).

This philosophy presents structural alignment with organizational collaboration needs. Ubuntu's relational ontology matches how IT departments actually function: individuals defined by their departmental roles and relationships, success measured collectively not individually, decisions requiring consultation across hierarchy levels, and problems solved through coordinated team efforts rather than individual optimization.

Ubuntu provides stability as a cultural framework. While organizational policies evolve and AI capabilities advance rapidly, cultural principles remain constant, offering unchanging ethical and operational grounding (Mkhize, 2022). This stability makes Ubuntu particularly valuable for guiding AI systems in dynamic environments.

**The Research Question:** Can Ubuntu philosophy effectively bridge the gap between AI agent capabilities and real organizational IT operations? No empirical evidence currently exists validating this potential bridging mechanism.

### 2.3 UGENTIC as Research Instrument

To investigate this question empirically, this research develops UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Agentic Collective Intelligence) as a research instrument—not a product for deployment, but an artifact enabling systematic investigation of whether Ubuntu can bridge AI-organizational gaps.

UGENTIC consists of six AI agents mirroring Sun International GrandWest Casino's actual IT department structure:

- **IT Manager Agent** (Strategic Level): Organizational IT leadership, resource allocation
- **Service Desk Manager Agent** (Tactical Level): Team coordination, operational oversight (manages IT Support only)
- **IT Support Agent** (Operational Level): Front-line technical support (reports to Service Desk Manager)
- **Application Support Agent** (Operational Level): Software troubleshooting (reports directly to IT Manager)
- **Network Support Agent** (Operational Level): Network infrastructure (reports directly to IT Manager)
- **Infrastructure Agent** (Operational Level): Server and system management (reports directly to IT Manager)

This hierarchy authentically reflects GrandWest's actual structure, enabling investigation of whether Ubuntu principles can bridge AI capabilities with real organizational workflows and hierarchical relationships.

The agents implement Ubuntu principles through specific behaviors: acknowledging others' expertise before contributing, articulating collective benefits not individual gains, adopting consultative rather than directive approaches, providing transparent reasoning accessible to all levels, and offering mutual support across departmental boundaries.

UGENTIC serves as the research artifact through which we investigate: Do IT stakeholders experience these Ubuntu-driven agents as effectively bridging the gap between AI capabilities and their real work practices? This empirical validation through stakeholder experiences constitutes the core research contribution.

### 2.4 Problem Statement

Despite extensive separate research in multi-agent AI systems (Moore, 2025; Krishnan, 2025), Ubuntu philosophy (Mhlambi, 2020; Odero et al., 2024), and organizational IT operations (Davenport & Ronanki, 2021; Aldoseri et al., 2024), **no empirical evidence exists of Ubuntu philosophy bridging AI-organizational gaps in real IT departments**.

This absence of validated bridging mechanisms prevents organizations from confidently addressing the AI-organizational disconnect. The Upwork and Gallup data demonstrate that current AI implementations fail to enhance organizational operations, yet no validated cultural frameworks exist for bridging this gap.

This research addresses this void by providing the first empirical investigation of Ubuntu as a bridging mechanism between AI capabilities and organizational IT operations, validated through stakeholder experiences across organizational levels in a real IT department context.

### 2.5 Research Aim

**Primary Aim:** To investigate whether Ubuntu philosophy can effectively bridge the gap between AI agent capabilities and real organizational IT operations, validated through stakeholder experiences of IT department staff across strategic, tactical, and operational levels.

**Secondary Aims:**
- Identify specific gaps between AI capabilities and real IT workflows, hierarchies, and collaboration needs
- Understand how Ubuntu principles can be operationalized as bridging mechanisms in multi-agent systems
- Validate bridging effectiveness through stakeholder assessment of experiences
- Extract design principles for transferability to other IT departments facing similar challenges

This research aims to validate Ubuntu as a bridging mechanism through empirical evidence from stakeholder experiences, not to develop a deployable system or measure technical performance metrics.

## 4. Literature Review

The literature review examines four critical areas establishing the foundation for investigating Ubuntu as an AI-organizational bridging mechanism. With 93 peer-reviewed sources (80% from 2024-2025), this review demonstrates comprehensive coverage of the research problem, proposed solution, validation methodology, and transferability considerations.

### 4.1 AI-Organizational Gaps: The Problem (Addresses RQ1)

Extensive evidence documents persistent gaps between AI capabilities and organizational realities. Davenport and Ronanki (2021) identify how traditional AI implementations ignore organizational hierarchies, optimize individual performance at expense of collective goals, and lack cultural coherence with collaborative values. Bean (2025) examines how companies used AI in 2024, revealing that successful integration remains elusive despite technical sophistication. The Upwork Research Institute (2024) provides empirical evidence of this gap: 77% of employees using AI report increased workload, with 47% uncertain how to achieve productivity gains. Gallup (2024) corroborates this disconnect, finding only 15% of employees report clear organizational AI strategy.

Kanter (2020) explores how organizational silos impede collaboration, while Aldoseri et al. (2024) documents integration challenges even when automation capabilities exist. These studies establish that the gap exists not due to insufficient technical capability but due to misalignment between AI design assumptions and organizational operational realities.

South African context adds specific dimensions to this gap. CIPIT (2025) analyzes AI ecosystems across Africa, identifying infrastructure and skills challenges. Nzama et al. (2024) examines AI adoption barriers in South African manufacturing, revealing contextual factors affecting implementation. McKinsey (2025) projects significant economic value potential for generative AI in African markets, yet notes persistent adoption challenges.

**Research Gap from RQ1 Perspective:** While gaps are well-documented, validated bridging mechanisms remain absent from literature.

### 4.2 Ubuntu Philosophy as Bridging Mechanism (Addresses RQ2)

Ubuntu philosophy presents a potential solution through its emphasis on collective humanity and relational ontology. Mhlambi (2020) establishes Ubuntu as an AI ethics and governance framework, arguing that relationality provides more appropriate grounding than pure Western rationality for AI systems operating in organizational contexts. The foundational principle *umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu* ("I am because we are") offers cultural coherence with organizational collaboration needs.

Recent scholarship has significantly expanded Ubuntu's application to AI systems. Odero et al. (2024) identifies nine operationalization themes for Ubuntu in AI: relationality and interconnectedness, communal decision-making, respect and human dignity, social harmony, collective responsibility, restorative justice and reconciliation, consensus building, hospitality and care, and cultural authenticity. These themes provide concrete mechanisms for translating philosophy into computational behaviors.

Gwagwa et al. (2022) examines African values in global AI governance, demonstrating how communal principles offer alternatives to individualistic AI design assumptions. Frempong et al. (2024) explores Ubuntu's role in addressing AI ethics challenges, particularly regarding collective responsibility and communal decision-making. Mkhize (2022) addresses Ubuntu's role in global AI inclusion discourse from normative ethics perspectives, establishing frameworks for avoiding cultural appropriation while maintaining philosophical authenticity.

Additional Ubuntu scholarship strengthens the theoretical foundation. Udah et al. (2025) examines Ubuntu philosophy, values, and principles, establishing the moral and relational frameworks underlying African personhood. Wareham (2021) explores African conceptions of personhood in AI contexts, clarifying how relational ontology informs technological ethics. van Norren (2023) discusses community reconstitution through shared values, providing insights into practical implementation. These sources establish Ubuntu's philosophical depth and its applicability to contemporary organizational and technological contexts.

**Critical Analysis:** Ubuntu's emphasis on relationality structurally aligns with multi-agent systems where agents are defined by relationships. Collective responsibility matches organizational needs for team-based outcomes. Communal decision-making mirrors authentic hierarchical consultation patterns. However, tensions exist: Ubuntu's egalitarian tendencies may conflict with organizational hierarchies; formalization of relational practices risks reducing authentic human connection to algorithmic rules; Western technological frameworks may resist African philosophical integration.

**Research Gap from RQ2 Perspective:** While Ubuntu principles are well-theorized, empirical evidence of successful operationalization in AI systems bridging organizational gaps does not exist.

### 4.3 Multi-Agent AI Systems: Technical Feasibility (Addresses RQ2)

Multi-agent systems provide technical architecture for implementing Ubuntu bridging mechanisms. Moore (2025) presents hierarchical multi-agent taxonomy for industrial applications, establishing that agent architectures can represent organizational structures. Krishnan (2025) introduces the Model Context Protocol for agent interoperability, enabling coordinated communication essential for bridging departmental silos. Ju (2025) demonstrates 73% productivity improvements in human-agent collaboration, though primarily in controlled environments rather than authentic organizational contexts.

Wu et al. (2023) develops AutoGen framework enabling next-generation LLM applications via multi-agent conversation, demonstrating technical feasibility of sophisticated agent coordination. However, these frameworks lack cultural grounding or organizational integration principles.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems enable knowledge sharing across agents. Balaguer et al. (2025) presents contemporary RAG frameworks for enterprise knowledge management, including GraphRAG and hierarchical retrieval. Zhang et al. (2024) develops RAG framework specifically for IT operations, directly relevant to this research context. Ranjan et al. (2024) provides comprehensive RAG survey, establishing state-of-the-art capabilities. These technologies enable collective knowledge access—a technical implementation of Ubuntu's knowledge-sharing principles.

**Synthesis:** Technical capabilities exist for implementing Ubuntu bridging mechanisms. Hierarchical multi-agent architectures (Moore, 2025) can mirror organizational structures. Communication protocols (Krishnan, 2025) enable coordination. RAG systems (Balaguer et al., 2025) facilitate collective knowledge access. The technical feasibility question is resolved; the remaining question is whether Ubuntu cultural framing enhances organizational integration—which requires empirical validation.

### 4.4 Stakeholder Validation & Organizational Context (Addresses RQ3 & RQ4)

Validating bridging effectiveness requires understanding how stakeholders experience AI integration. National Academies (2022) provides comprehensive human-AI teaming framework, establishing evaluation criteria for assessing collaboration effectiveness. Daugherty and Wilson (2024) reimagines work in the age of AI, emphasizing complementary human-machine strengths and providing frameworks for organizational fit assessment. Berretta et al. (2023) examines human-centered AI teaming, establishing principles for complementary collaborative intelligence.

Braun and Clarke (2024) presents reflexive thematic analysis methodology, enabling systematic analysis of stakeholder meaning-making around Ubuntu-AI bridging experiences. This methodology respects stakeholder interpretations rather than imposing researcher frameworks, appropriate for investigating whether cultural bridging is experienced as authentic.

Organizational implementation research establishes transferability foundations. Aldoseri et al. (2024) provides automation integration roadmap with practical guidelines adaptable across contexts. Holmström et al. (2025) presents phased AI transformation framework for organizational journeys, with SME applicability emphasis. Bean (2025) identifies successful adoption patterns transferable to other organizations.

Contextual considerations affect transferability. Mastercard (2025) explores AI's transformative potential across African sectors. Mbonye (2024) addresses POPIA compliance for AI systems, establishing South African regulatory frameworks. These contextual factors inform adaptation strategies for different organizational environments.

**Synthesis:** Frameworks exist for stakeholder validation (National Academies, 2022; Braun & Clarke, 2024) and transferability assessment (Aldoseri et al., 2024; Holmström et al., 2025). The methodology for empirically validating Ubuntu as bridging mechanism is established.

### 4.5 Identified Research Gap

**Critical Void:** While extensive research exists in multi-agent AI systems, Ubuntu philosophy, and organizational IT operations separately, **no empirical evidence exists of Ubuntu philosophy bridging AI-organizational gaps in real IT departments**.

This study addresses this void by providing:
- First empirical investigation of Ubuntu as AI-organizational bridging mechanism
- Stakeholder-validated evidence from real IT department context
- Design principles for culturally-grounded AI bridging organizational gaps
- Transferable framework for other IT departments

The research contribution is empirical validation of a theoretically promising but empirically untested bridging mechanism.
