## üîç SESSION 34 CITATION VERIFICATION AUDIT (23 October 2025)

**Purpose:** Systematic verification of 12 missing citations identified during dissertation writing  
**Method:** Web search verification of each citation's existence and accuracy  
**Searches Used:** 18 of available searches  
**Status:** COMPLETE - All 12 citations investigated

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED & ADDED TO BIBLIOGRAPHY (3 sources)

These citations were successfully verified, found to be accurate, and have been added to the appropriate sections above:

1. **Murove, M.F. (2012)** - ‚úÖ VERIFIED & ADDED  
   Full citation: Murove, M.F. (2012). Ubuntu. *Diogenes*, 59(3-4), 36-47.  
   **Location in bibliography:** Ubuntu Philosophy and AI/Technology section  
   **Verification notes:** Published in peer-reviewed journal, discusses post-colonial African philosophy and Ubuntu's relational worldview. Available via multiple academic databases.

2. **Braun, V., & Clarke, V. (2024)** - ‚úÖ VERIFIED & ADDED  
   Full citation: Braun, V., & Clarke, V. (2024). Supporting best practice in reflexive thematic analysis reporting in Palliative Medicine: A review of published research and introduction to the Reflexive Thematic Analysis Reporting Guidelines (RTARG). *Palliative Medicine*, 38(6), 608-616.  
   **Location in bibliography:** Reflexive Thematic Analysis section (to be created if needed)  
   **Verification notes:** Latest RTARG guidelines from Braun & Clarke. Published March 2024, peer-reviewed. Provides methodological reporting standards for reflexive TA.

3. **Birhane, A. (2021)** - ‚úÖ VERIFIED BUT WITH CONCERNS (see below)  
   Full citation: Birhane, A. (2021). Algorithmic injustice: a relational ethics approach. *Patterns*, 2(2), 100205.  
   **Location in bibliography:** To be added pending verification of how it's cited  
   **Verification notes:** Valid publication, BUT content is about algorithmic injustice and relational ethics, NOT specifically about multi-agent systems or Ubuntu ontology as may be cited in dissertation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CITATIONS REQUIRING VERIFICATION IN DISSERTATION (3 sources)

These citations were found but have discrepancies that require checking against actual dissertation usage:

4. **Birhane, 2021** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONTENT MISMATCH CONCERN**  
   **What was found:** Birhane, A. (2021). Algorithmic injustice: a relational ethics approach. *Patterns*, 2(2), 100205.  
   **The concern:** This paper discusses relational ethics and algorithmic injustice in AI systems generally. If dissertation cites it for claims about "multi-agent systems where agents are literally defined by their relationships" or "Ubuntu's relational ontology in MAS design," this may be an incorrect attribution.  
   **Action needed:** Check Chapter 1 to verify what claim is attributed to this source. If mismatch confirmed, either:
   - Find correct source for the multi-agent systems claim, OR
   - Revise claim to match what Birhane 2021 actually discusses (relational ethics in AI)

5. **Braun, Clarke & Rance** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **POSSIBLE DATE ERROR**  
   **What was found:** Braun, V., Clarke, V., & Rance, N. (2014). How to use thematic analysis with interview data. In A. Vossler & N. Moller (Eds.), *The counselling and psychotherapy research handbook* (pp. 183-197). Sage.  
   **The concern:** If dissertation cites this as "Braun, Clarke & Rance (2024)," this is incorrect - the correct year is 2014.  
   **Action needed:** Check Chapter 3 in-text citations. If cited as 2024, update to 2014. Note: Source is now 11 years old (pre-2020), may need justification or replacement with more recent Braun & Clarke work (their 2022 textbook or 2024 RTARG guidelines).

6. **Rettov√°, 2020** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL MATCH - NEEDS VERIFICATION**  
   **What was found:** Article on Swahili philosophy of "utu" (cognate of Ubuntu) published in *Decolonial Subversions* (2020) by Alena Rettov√°.  
   **The concern:** Multiple publications by Rettov√° in 2020-2021 on African philosophy. Need exact title and page numbers to confirm correct source.  
   **Action needed:** Check dissertation to see:
   - Exact title cited
   - What claim is attributed (likely about Ubuntu's ontological claims or philosophical debates)
   - Whether "Decolonial Subversions" article or another 2020 publication

### ‚ùå CITATIONS NOT FOUND - REQUIRE URGENT ATTENTION (6 sources)

   - Wrong author surname (similar name?)
   - Unpublished conference paper or working paper
   - Citation created in error
   **Action required:**

   **Possible explanations:**
   - Date error - should be 1999 or 2005
   - Different Ramose publication from 2019 (book chapter, journal article)
   - Citation confusion with different author
   **Action required:** 
   - Likely should cite: Ramose, M.B. (1999/2005) *African Philosophy Through Ubuntu*  
   - Check if there's a 2019 article by Ramose you meant to cite
   - Update all in-text citations accordingly

9. **Gade, 2021** - ‚ùå NOT FOUND

   - Different Gade publication
   **Action required:** 
   - Determine which Gade article you actually used
   - Update year to correct date (likely 2011 or 2012)
   - If using 2011 source, note it's now 14 years old (consider if pre-2020 source acceptable for this claim)

10. **Banks, 2022** - ‚ùå NOT FOUND  
   **What was searched:** "Banks 2022 research ethics Ubuntu applications African philosophy"  
   **What was found:** No publication by anyone named Banks on Ubuntu and research ethics in 2022. Found various AI ethics publications but none matching this citation.  
   **Possible explanations:**
