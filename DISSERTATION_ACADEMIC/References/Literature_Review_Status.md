## üéØ **CRITICAL RESEARCH GAP IDENTIFIED**

**Finding:** Extensive research exists in multi-agent AI, Ubuntu philosophy, and organizational implementation **separately**, but virtually **NO research combining Ubuntu philosophy with multi-agent organizational AI systems in real IT departments**.

**Implication:** Your dissertation addresses a significant unexplored intersection, positioning it for foundational contributions to this emerging field.

**Enhancement Impact:** The addition of ITSM, network management, and IT collaboration sources strengthens the practical organizational implementation dimension, directly supporting the 6-agent departmental hierarchy (including Network Support).
