# **The Practical Guide to Your Dissertation: An Actionable Blueprint**

This guide is your primary operational document for completing your dissertation. It consolidates all institutional requirements, strategic advice, and project milestones into a single, actionable blueprint for success.

### **Section 1: The Core Mandate & Strategic Positioning**

Every decision must align with these foundational principles.

* **The 70% IT Focus Rule:** This is a non-negotiable requirement. Your project, centered on designing and evaluating the **UGENTIC multi-agent AI system**, must consistently emphasize its technical components: the multi-agent architecture, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the local LLM implementation, and the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology as an IT artifact creation process.  
* **The Primary Contribution (Your "So What?"):** Your research is the **first documented practical implementation and empirical validation** of an Ubuntu-driven AI system in a real-world organizational context. This is your unique selling point and must be highlighted in your abstract, introduction, and conclusion.  
* **The Solved Problem:** Frame your work as a direct, practical, and culturally resonant solution to two key problems:  
  1. The failure of Western-centric business and technology models in the South African context.  
  2. The global disconnect between AI capabilities and actual workplace practices, where AI often increases, rather than decreases, workloads.

### **Section 2: The Dissertation Blueprint (Structure & Content)**

Your dissertation must be **45,000-50,000 words** (approximately **80-120 pages**) and adhere to this seven-chapter format.

* **Chapter 1: Introduction:** **Complete.** (Derived from your approved research proposal).  
* **Chapter 2: Literature Review:** **Complete.** (Derived from your approved research proposal).  
* **Chapter 3: Research Methodology:** **Complete.** (Details the DSR framework, case study, and data analysis plan).  
* **Chapter 4: System Design and Implementation:** **Complete.** (Details the UGENTIC prototype and proves the "70% IT Focus").  
* **Chapter 5: Design Validation Findings:** **PENDING.** This is your **most critical remaining task**. This chapter will be populated entirely by the data from your semi-structured interviews with the 10-14 IT staff at Sun International. You must rigorously apply the Thematic Analysis method to present the findings and answer your research questions.  
* **Chapter 6: Discussion:** **Drafted.** This chapter **must be heavily revised** after Chapter 5 is complete. You will compare your findings with the literature from Chapter 2, discuss the implications of your results, and analyze the effectiveness of the UGENTIC design.  
* **Chapter 7: Conclusion and Recommendations:** **Drafted.** This chapter **must be revised** after Chapters 5 and 6 are finalized. It should summarize the entire project, explicitly state how you have achieved your research aim, and reiterate your unique contribution.

### **Section 3: The Rules of Academic Evidence (Literature & Referencing)**

Adherence to these rules is mandatory and directly impacts the credibility and grading of your work.

* **The 3-to-5-Year Rule:** All sources must be published within the last five years. The gold standard is to keep references within a **three-year window** to demonstrate maximum currency.  
* **Citing Foundational/Old Sources:** Do not cite seminal works directly. Instead, find a **recent paper** that discusses that foundational work and cite the recent paper.  
* **Approved Sources:** Your literature must come from peer-reviewed academic databases like **Emerald, EBSCO, and Springer**.  
* **Referencing Style:** All citations and the final bibliography must strictly adhere to the **Harvard referencing style**.

### **Section 4: The Path to Completion (Process & Milestones)**

This is your project plan through the final submission deadline of **December 5, 2025**.

1. **Data Collection (Immediate Priority):**  
   * You have the approved **Ethical Clearance**.  
   * Conduct the semi-structured interviews with the 10-14 IT staff at Sun International using your established interview protocol.  
2. **Data Analysis:**  
   * Transcribe all interviews.  
   * Apply the six-phase thematic analysis method to identify key themes and patterns that answer your research questions.  
3. **Writing & Integration:**  
   * **Write Chapter 5:** Present the themes and findings from your analysis, using anonymized quotes as evidence.  
   * **Revise Chapter 6:** Discuss your findings in the context of your literature review.  
   * **Revise Chapter 7:** Finalize your conclusions and recommendations.  
4. **Supervisor Communication Protocol:**  
   * **Primary Channel:** Use the designated **MS Teams class** for all communication to ensure faster, prioritized responses.  
   * **Weekly Updates:** Provide a brief progress report every Friday.  
   * **Managing Feedback Delays:** Do not halt your progress while waiting for feedback. If you have submitted a chapter for review, **begin working on the next chapter immediately** to maintain momentum.

### **Section 5: Final Submission Requirements**

On or before the deadline, you must submit two distinct components:

1. **The Artifact:** The working **UGENTIC research prototype**.  
2. **The Dissertation:** The complete, **80-120 page** written document in MS Word format.  
* **External Examination:** The final dissertation will be graded by external experts. Your work must be clear, well-written, and academically rigorous.  
* **Optional Proofreading:** Consider using the institution's recommended external proofreading service for a final quality assurance check before submission.

### **Section 6: The Final Pre-Submission Checklist**
