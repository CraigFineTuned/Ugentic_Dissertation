# **Meeting Summary & Action Plan: Jemina Matiya**

**Date:** 17 October 2025

Today, I had my dissertation meeting with my supervisor, Jemina. It was a very important meeting that has given me a clearer direction. I also officially received my **Ethical Clearance Letter**, which means I can now proceed with data collection.

Here are my main takeaways and deductions from our discussion.

### **The Core Issue: Research Questions & System Focus**

The main problem we identified is that my current research questions are too vague, broad, and technical. They are too heavily focused on the **UGENTIC system** I am developing, and Jemina rightly pointed out that the dissertation needs to be grounded in research, writing, and findings—not just the development of a tool.

I had explained that I intended for the system to be a method to strengthen my research and promote transparency in AI. However, I now agree with her that I took the system development aspect too far and need to shift my primary focus back to the research itself.

### **Key Action Items & Feedback**

1. **Refine Research Questions (Top Priority):**  
   * The current questions are too technical and lack a clear, non-technical purpose.  
   * I need to start with more theoretical questions.  
   * The goal is to have **four solid, specific research questions** that guide the entire dissertation. This was the main focus of our meeting.  
2. **De-emphasize the UGENTIC System:**  
   * I need to reduce the hype around my own system in the dissertation.  
   * Jemina is not fully convinced of the need for me to build a new system from scratch, as there may be other AI tools I can use or reference.  
   * The research, not the system, must be the star of the show.  
3. **Broaden My Research Scope:**  
   * I shouldn't limit my evidence and analysis to only my own development work.  
   * I need to incorporate other research, tools, and methodologies (like thematic analysis for my qualitative data) to support my claims and address any deficiencies.  
4. **Deepen the "Ubuntu" Philosophy:**  
   * Jemina emphasized the importance of thoroughly investigating "Ubuntu." She is fond of this aspect, especially my highlight on the "I am because we are" philosophy.  
   * I must explore its different meanings across various African cultures to give it the academic depth it deserves.  
   * My connection of Ubuntu to my system's name (UGENTIC) is a good idea, but the philosophical investigation must come first.  
5. **Refine the Problem Statement & Know My Limitations:**  
   * I need to rewrite my problem statement to clearly address the research challenges. This will naturally follow after I refine the research questions.  
   * I must not go beyond the scope of my research. Providing too much evidence can lead to loose ends and weaken my overall argument.

### **Ethical Clearance for Data Collection**

I have successfully received my ethical clearance to proceed with data collection.

**To Whom It May Concern**

**RE: ETHICAL CLEARANCE CONFIRMATION**

This letter serves as confirmation that Craig Vraagom, student Number 402415017 is currently enrolled for Bachelor of Science Honours in Information Technology in the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies at Richfield Graduate Institute of Technology.

Craig is undertaking a dissertation module under the supervision of Jemina Matiya. As part of the programme fulfilment requirements, Craig has to conduct a research study and submit a dissertation thesis project titled: “Investigating Ubuntu Philosophy in Multi-Agent AI Systems for Organizational Support: A Case Study of Sun International GrandWest Casino, South Africa.”

The ethical implications of this research topic were reviewed and have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Postgraduate Studies. The ethical clearance number is **BSCH202588**.

Craig is now in the process of approaching relevant organisations in order to collect research data. We would be grateful if you could allow Craig to collect data sample from your institution.

If you need any additional information, please directly contact the supervisor: JeminaM@richfield.ac.za

### **My Conclusion & Path Forward**

This feedback is a valuable opportunity for me to pivot towards a more robust and academically sound dissertation. My next steps are clear. I need to focus on rewriting my research questions, grounding my work in a deep understanding of Ubuntu, and placing my analysis within the broader field of AI.

By doing this, my UGENTIC system will become a compelling piece of evidence or a case study that supports my thesis, rather than being the entire focus of it.
