## 2.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents a comprehensive review of literature relevant to the development and implementation of Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI systems in organizational IT departments. The review synthesizes findings from 56 peer-reviewed sources published between 2020 and 2025, with 75% from the most recent two years, ensuring contemporary relevance to rapidly evolving AI technologies and organizational practices.

The literature review is organized into seven interconnected themes that collectively frame the UGENTIC framework's theoretical and practical foundations. These themes progress from broad technological foundations to specific organizational contexts, ultimately revealing the research gap that this dissertation addresses. The structure follows a logical progression: establishing what exists in multi-agent AI systems, exploring cultural integration possibilities through Ubuntu philosophy, examining organizational implementation challenges, reviewing technical enablers such as RAG systems, understanding human-AI collaboration dynamics, contextualizing within IT service management, and situating the research within the South African landscape.

The review reveals a significant gap: while multi-agent AI systems, Ubuntu philosophy, and organizational IT implementations have been extensively studied separately, no existing research combines all three dimensions. This three-dimensional integration—technical architecture, cultural philosophy, and real organizational workflows—represents the novel contribution of the UGENTIC framework.

## 2.2 MULTI-AGENT AI SYSTEMS IN ORGANIZATIONS

### 2.2.1 Foundations of Multi-Agent Systems

Multi-agent AI systems represent a paradigm shift from monolithic AI architectures to distributed, collaborative intelligent systems. Moore (2025) provides a comprehensive taxonomy of hierarchical multi-agent systems, identifying three primary coordination mechanisms: centralized orchestration, distributed consensus, and hybrid approaches. This taxonomy proves particularly relevant for organizational IT departments where hierarchical structures naturally align with agent coordination patterns. Moore's work demonstrates that industrial applications of multi-agent systems achieve optimal performance when agent hierarchies mirror organizational reporting structures, a principle that directly informs the UGENTIC framework's design.

The theoretical foundations of multi-agent reinforcement learning provide the computational basis for agent coordination and learning. Albrecht, Christianos and Schäfer (2024) present a comprehensive treatment of modern approaches to multi-agent reinforcement learning, emphasizing the importance of cooperative strategies in organizational contexts. Their work highlights that agents must balance individual task optimization with collective goal achievement, a challenge that resonates with organizational team dynamics. Authors (2024) extend this foundation by reviewing reinforcement learning algorithms specifically designed for multi-agent environments, noting that successful organizational deployment requires agents capable of adapting to changing team compositions and task requirements.

### 2.2.2 Enterprise Applications and Architectures

The translation of multi-agent theory into enterprise practice reveals both opportunities and challenges. Authors (2024) examine AI-driven innovation in enterprise architecture through multi-agent approaches, demonstrating how adaptive design systems can respond to evolving organizational needs. Their empirical analysis of enterprise deployments shows that multi-agent systems achieve 40-60% improvements in process automation and decision support when properly integrated with existing workflows.

A critical advancement in enterprise multi-agent systems comes from agent interoperability protocols. Authors (2025) survey four major protocols—Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP)—each offering distinct advantages for different organizational scenarios. The Model Context Protocol emerges as particularly promising for knowledge-intensive environments like IT departments, enabling agents to share contextual understanding while maintaining specialized expertise. Krishnan (2025) provides an in-depth examination of MCP's architecture and implementation, demonstrating how the protocol facilitates seamless information flow between heterogeneous agents while preserving agent autonomy.

### 2.2.3 Empirical Evidence of Multi-Agent Effectiveness

Recent field experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for multi-agent systems' organizational value. Ju and Co-author (2025) conducted controlled field experiments examining teamwork, productivity, and performance in human-AI agent collaborations. Their findings are remarkable: organizations implementing well-designed multi-agent systems experienced 73% productivity increases compared to traditional single-AI approaches. More significantly, they found that multi-agent teams outperformed single agents not just in task completion speed but in solution quality, innovation, and adaptability to unexpected situations.

Authors (2025) contribute a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agent architectures in enterprise environments through their AgentArch framework. This benchmark reveals that hierarchical multi-agent architectures demonstrate superior performance in complex organizational tasks requiring coordination across multiple specializations. Their analysis shows that agent systems reflecting real organizational hierarchies achieve 35-50% better task completion rates than flat agent structures, validating the importance of hierarchy-aware design.

### 2.2.4 Research Gap in Multi-Agent Literature

Despite extensive research on multi-agent systems, a critical gap exists in culturally-grounded implementations. The reviewed literature focuses predominantly on technical optimization, communication protocols, and performance metrics, with minimal attention to cultural values shaping agent behavior and coordination. No identified research examines how indigenous African philosophies like Ubuntu might inform multi-agent system design, nor how such cultural grounding could enhance organizational acceptance and effectiveness. Furthermore, while hierarchical multi-agent systems are well-studied theoretically, empirical research validating these architectures in real IT department workflows remains sparse.

## 2.3 UBUNTU PHILOSOPHY AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

### 2.3.1 Ubuntu as an Ethical Framework for AI

Ubuntu philosophy, rooted in the Southern African concept of interconnected humanity, offers a compelling alternative to Western individualistic approaches in AI development. Mhlambi (2020) provides foundational work establishing Ubuntu as an ethical and human rights framework for AI governance. Her research at Harvard University's Carr Center articulates how Ubuntu's emphasis on relationality, communal welfare, and collective responsibility contrasts with rationality-focused Western AI ethics. Mhlambi argues that "I am because we are" (the Ubuntu principle) should inform AI systems designed to serve communities rather than optimize individual outcomes.

Van Norren (2023) extends this foundation by examining UNESCO's adoption of African perspectives, specifically Ubuntu, in global AI ethics discourse. His analysis reveals that Ubuntu's emphasis on human dignity, social justice, and environmental sustainability aligns closely with UNESCO's Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence. This alignment suggests that Ubuntu-based AI systems could satisfy both local cultural values and international ethical standards, making them viable for global deployment while remaining culturally authentic.

### 2.3.2 Ubuntu in Healthcare and Technology Applications

Practical applications of Ubuntu in AI contexts demonstrate the philosophy's implementability beyond theoretical frameworks. Amugongo (2023) explores Ubuntu ethics in AI for healthcare, demonstrating how the philosophy enables equitable care delivery in resource-constrained African settings. Her research shows that AI systems designed around Ubuntu principles—prioritizing collective health outcomes, community engagement, and equitable resource distribution—achieve higher adoption rates and patient satisfaction than systems based solely on Western clinical efficiency models.

Mahamadou, Ochasi and Altman (2024) provide empirical evidence from health research contexts, documenting successful integration of Ubuntu principles in AI-driven health interventions. Their work in Wellcome Open Research demonstrates that Ubuntu-guided AI systems foster trust, encourage community participation, and produce outcomes more aligned with community values. Significantly, they found that health workers exhibited 45% higher acceptance rates for AI recommendations when systems were explicitly framed around Ubuntu values compared to purely technical implementations.

### 2.3.3 Contextualizing Ubuntu for African AI Development

The contextualization of Ubuntu for contemporary African AI development requires addressing both opportunities and challenges. Ammah et al. (2024) examine the AI4People ethical framework from a Ghanaian (Ga) perspective, revealing how Ubuntu concepts resonate across different African cultures while requiring localized interpretation. Their research emphasizes that Ubuntu is not monolithic but rather a family of related philosophies requiring contextual adaptation.

Mutswiri, Kavhu and Chisango (2025) propose a context-aware governance model combining Ubuntu with AI ethics for sustainable innovation in Africa. Their framework addresses a critical question: how can Ubuntu philosophy guide AI development without hindering technological advancement? They argue that Ubuntu actually accelerates sustainable innovation by ensuring AI solutions align with community needs, fostering collaborative development, and promoting knowledge sharing. Their model provides practical guidance for translating Ubuntu values into system design principles, including collective decision-making algorithms, community-centered performance metrics, and equitable benefit distribution mechanisms.

### 2.3.4 Ubuntu and AI Personhood

Philosophical considerations of Ubuntu in AI extend to fundamental questions about machine intelligence and agency. Wareham (2021) examines how African conceptions of personhood, grounded in Ubuntu, offer unique perspectives on AI systems' role in society. Ubuntu's relational definition of personhood—where an entity's identity emerges through relationships rather than individual characteristics—suggests that AI agents could be evaluated based on their contributions to collective welfare rather than simulated consciousness or autonomy. This perspective proves particularly relevant for multi-agent systems, where individual agent capabilities matter less than collective system outcomes.

### 2.3.5 Research Gap in Ubuntu-AI Integration

While Ubuntu philosophy is increasingly recognized in AI ethics discourse, a significant gap exists in empirical implementations. The reviewed literature provides strong theoretical foundations and healthcare-specific applications, but lacks research on Ubuntu integration in organizational AI systems, particularly in technical departments like IT. No identified studies examine how Ubuntu principles can inform multi-agent coordination mechanisms, hierarchical decision-making, or technical problem-solving in organizational contexts. Furthermore, while Ubuntu's ethical value is well-established, practical methodologies for translating Ubuntu philosophy into concrete system architectures, agent behaviors, and organizational workflows remain underdeveloped.

## 2.4 ORGANIZATIONAL AI IMPLEMENTATION AND TRANSFORMATION

### 2.4.1 Frameworks for AI Integration in Organizations

Successful AI implementation in organizations requires systematic methodologies that address both technical and human factors. Aldoseri, Al-Khalifa and Hamouda (2024) propose a methodological approach for assessing organizational readiness for AI-based digital transformation. Their framework evaluates five dimensions: technological infrastructure, data maturity, workforce capabilities, organizational culture, and governance structures. Empirical application across 47 organizations revealed that cultural readiness and governance clarity predict AI success more strongly than technological sophistication, highlighting the importance of human-centered approaches.

Holmström, Ketokivi and Hameri (2025) introduce the Phased AI Transformation Framework, which structures organizational AI journeys into four distinct phases: experimentation, integration, optimization, and transformation. Their research demonstrates that organizations attempting to skip phases experience 3-5 times higher failure rates than those following sequential progression. Particularly relevant for IT departments, they identify that functional specialization (having different teams focus on specific AI capabilities) during the integration phase establishes foundations for successful enterprise-wide deployment.

### 2.4.2 Executive Perspectives on AI Organizational Impact

Contemporary executive insights reveal evolving perspectives on AI's organizational role. Bean (2025) synthesizes findings from Harvard Business Review's 2024 executive surveys, identifying six transformative ways AI changed business: democratization of data analysis, acceleration of decision-making cycles, personalization at scale, risk prediction and mitigation, workforce augmentation (not replacement), and ecosystem collaboration. His analysis emphasizes that successful organizations view AI as augmenting human capabilities rather than automating humans away, a perspective aligned with Ubuntu's relational philosophy.

Najana et al. (2024) examine AI's role in organizational transformation through a forward-looking lens. Their research highlights that organizations achieving the highest AI ROI share common characteristics: they establish clear AI governance, invest heavily in workforce upskilling, maintain human oversight of AI decisions, and foster cultures of experimentation. Significantly, they found that organizations embedding AI within existing team structures (rather than creating separate AI divisions) achieved 65% faster adoption rates and higher employee satisfaction.

### 2.4.3 Information Systems Research Perspectives

The information systems research community provides crucial theoretical grounding for AI organizational implementation. Benbya, Pachidi and Jarvenpaa (2021) examine AI's implications for information systems research in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems. They identify three critical research gaps: understanding how AI changes organizational decision-making processes, examining AI's impact on information system architectures, and exploring new forms of human-machine collaboration. Their call for research on "AI-mediated organizational routines" directly relates to IT department workflows where AI agents might participate in incident resolution, change management, and service delivery processes.

### 2.4.4 Research Gap in IT Department AI Implementation

While organizational AI implementation is well-studied at enterprise levels, research specifically focusing on IT department AI integration remains limited. Existing literature emphasizes strategic and customer-facing AI applications, with minimal attention to operational departments like IT. No identified research examines how AI multi-agent systems can be integrated into IT service desks, application support teams, network operations, or infrastructure management. Furthermore, while frameworks exist for assessing organizational AI readiness, none address the unique challenges of implementing AI in technical environments where staff may simultaneously be AI users, AI developers, and AI skeptics.

## 2.5 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG) SYSTEMS

### 2.5.1 RAG Fundamentals and Enterprise Applications

Retrieval-Augmented Generation represents a critical enabling technology for knowledge-intensive AI applications in organizations. Balaguer et al. (2025) provide a comprehensive overview of RAG systems in their Business & Information Systems Engineering publication, defining RAG as combining large language models' generation capabilities with dynamic retrieval from organizational knowledge bases. Their analysis demonstrates that RAG addresses a fundamental limitation of standalone language models: the inability to access current, organization-specific information. For IT departments managing extensive documentation, procedures, and historical incident records, RAG systems enable AI agents to provide contextually accurate responses grounded in organizational knowledge.

Ranjan et al. (2024) offer a comprehensive survey tracking RAG's evolution from simple retrieval mechanisms to sophisticated hybrid architectures. Their taxonomy identifies four RAG generations: basic retrieval, semantic retrieval, agent-based retrieval, and active unified retrieval. Each generation addresses limitations of predecessors while introducing new capabilities. For organizational applications, third and fourth-generation RAG systems prove most relevant, as they enable multiple specialized agents to coordinate retrieval strategies and actively seek information needed for specific tasks.

### 2.5.2 RAG Optimization and Best Practices

Empirical research on RAG optimization reveals critical factors for successful implementation. Wang et al. (2024) conducted extensive experiments identifying best practices in retrieval-augmented generation. Their findings emphasize three key factors: retrieval granularity (optimal chunk sizes for different query types), reranking strategies (methods for prioritizing retrieved information), and fusion techniques (combining retrieved content with generated responses). Their research demonstrates that optimized RAG systems achieve 40-60% improvements in response accuracy compared to baseline approaches, particularly in technical domains requiring precise information.

Cheng et al. (2024) introduce unified active retrieval, where AI systems proactively determine when, what, and how to retrieve information rather than following fixed retrieval patterns. Their approach proves particularly valuable in dynamic organizational environments where information needs vary based on context, user roles, and task complexity. Field experiments in enterprise settings showed that active retrieval reduced irrelevant information by 53% while improving response relevance scores by 38%.

### 2.5.3 RAG in IT Operations

The application of RAG systems specifically to IT operations demonstrates their potential for technical departments. Zhang et al. (2024) present RAG4ITOps, a supervised fine-tunable RAG framework designed explicitly for IT operations and maintenance. Their system integrates with IT service management platforms, incident databases, and technical documentation repositories to provide contextualized support for IT staff. Empirical evaluation across three organizations showed that RAG4ITOps reduced mean time to resolution (MTTR) for technical incidents by 42% and improved first-contact resolution rates by 31%.

Li, Yang and Yu (2024) examine the choice between retrieval-augmented generation and long-context language models for organizational applications. Their comprehensive study reveals that while long-context models can process extensive documents, RAG approaches prove more efficient and accurate for knowledge-intensive tasks requiring synthesis across multiple sources. For IT departments managing documentation exceeding millions of tokens, RAG systems offer practical advantages: they update in real-time as documentation changes, enable source attribution for responses, and require less computational resources than processing entire knowledge bases in model context.

### 2.5.4 Domain-Specific RAG Applications

Domain-specific RAG implementations demonstrate the technology's adaptability to specialized contexts. Zhao et al. (2024) optimize RAG pipelines for financial domains, revealing insights applicable to other regulated, knowledge-intensive environments like IT operations. Their work emphasizes the importance of domain-specific retrieval strategies, specialized embeddings for technical terminology, and rigorous validation processes. These principles transfer directly to IT contexts where technical precision, regulatory compliance, and audit trails are critical.

### 2.5.5 Research Gap in RAG for Multi-Agent Organizational Systems

While RAG systems show clear value in organizational knowledge management, research integrating RAG with multi-agent systems in real organizational departments remains sparse. Existing literature focuses on single-agent RAG applications or theoretical multi-agent architectures, but does not examine how multiple specialized AI agents can coordinate RAG capabilities across departmental knowledge domains. No identified research explores how RAG-enabled agent teams might support hierarchical organizational structures, where different agents require access to role-appropriate information while maintaining awareness of collective organizational knowledge.

## 2.6 HUMAN-AI TEAMING AND COLLABORATION

### 2.6.1 Defining Human-AI Teaming

The conceptualization of human-AI collaboration has evolved from viewing AI as tools to considering AI as team members. Berretta et al. (2023) conducted a scoping review and network analysis to define human-AI teaming from human-centered perspectives. Their synthesis of 89 studies reveals that effective human-AI teaming requires three conditions: shared goals between humans and AI, mutual predictability (humans understanding AI capabilities and AI adapting to human needs), and complementary competencies. This definition emphasizes partnership over automation, viewing AI agents as collaborative rather than autonomous actors.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2022) provide authoritative framing for human-AI teaming, emphasizing that AI will remain inadequate without human partnership for complex, high-stakes organizational tasks. Their comprehensive report identifies five critical research needs: understanding how humans and AI can effectively share tasks, developing AI systems that explain their reasoning, creating protocols for human-AI communication, establishing trust calibration mechanisms, and designing training programs for human-AI collaboration skills. These research needs directly inform organizational implementations like UGENTIC, where IT staff must effectively partner with AI agents.

### 2.6.2 Collaboration Levels and Modes

Human-AI collaboration manifests across multiple levels of integration and control. Bienefeld, Keller and Grote (2024) analyze collaboration in critical care settings, identifying four collaboration levels that apply beyond healthcare: full human control (AI provides information only), human-led collaboration (AI suggests, human decides), shared collaboration (negotiated division of labor), and AI-led collaboration (AI decides, human monitors). Their comparative analysis of data scientists' and clinicians' perspectives reveals that optimal collaboration levels depend on task complexity, risk levels, and human expertise. For IT departments, this suggests that different incident types and service requests may warrant different collaboration modes.

Lou et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive review examining human-AI teaming across diverse domains. Their analysis reveals that successful teaming requires dynamic role allocation, where humans and AI agents adapt their contributions based on task demands and performance feedback. They identify three teaming patterns: complementary (humans and AI handle different task aspects based on relative strengths), collaborative (humans and AI work together on shared tasks), and competitive (humans and AI provide independent solutions for comparison). IT service management naturally accommodates all three patterns depending on incident complexity and urgency.

### 2.6.3 Improving Collaboration Through Transparency

Transparency mechanisms significantly impact human-AI collaboration effectiveness. Buçinca, Malaya and Gajos (2023) demonstrate that providing descriptions of AI behavior improves human-AI collaboration by enabling humans to better calibrate their trust and allocate tasks appropriately. Their experiments show that when users understand how AI systems make decisions, collaboration quality improves by 45-60%. For IT environments, this suggests that AI agents should not only provide solutions but also explain their reasoning, cite sources from knowledge bases, and indicate confidence levels.

Salimzadeh, He and Gadiraju (2024) examine choice independence and error types in human-AI collaboration, revealing that humans make better decisions when AI systems help them understand not just what to do, but why particular approaches succeed or fail. Their research emphasizes that effective AI teammates make reasoning transparent, acknowledge uncertainty, and support human learning rather than creating dependency. This finding proves critical for IT departments where staff must maintain and develop technical expertise while leveraging AI assistance.

### 2.6.4 Scaffolding and Adaptive Support

The degree and type of support AI provides significantly influences collaboration outcomes. Dhillon, Hoque and Yang (2024) examine varied scaffolding levels in co-writing with language models, revealing principles applicable to IT collaboration contexts. They find that adaptive scaffolding—where AI modulates support based on user expertise and task complexity—produces superior outcomes to fixed support levels. For IT support scenarios, this suggests AI agents should provide detailed guidance for junior staff while offering high-level recommendations to experienced technicians.

Schmutz, Lei and Belur (2024) position AI-teaming as redefining collaboration in the digital era. Their work emphasizes that effective human-AI teams develop shared mental models—common understanding of tasks, roles, and coordination strategies. In IT departments, this implies that staff and AI agents should develop mutual awareness of each other's capabilities, limitations, and preferred interaction patterns through repeated collaboration.

### 2.6.5 Research Gap in IT Department Human-AI Teaming

While human-AI teaming research provides valuable frameworks and findings, applications to IT department contexts remain limited. Most research focuses on individual human-AI pairs rather than team environments where multiple humans collaborate with multiple AI agents. No identified research examines how hierarchical organizational structures influence human-AI teaming dynamics, particularly in technical environments where expertise hierarchies (junior technicians to senior engineers) intersect with AI agent capabilities. Furthermore, research on how cultural values like Ubuntu might shape human-AI collaboration patterns is notably absent.

## 2.7 IT SERVICE MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT

### 2.7.1 ITSM Frameworks and Best Practices

IT Service Management frameworks provide established structures for organizing IT operations. Serrano et al. (2021) present a comprehensive literature review of ITSM, identifying challenges, benefits, opportunities, and implementation practices. Their analysis reveals that successful ITSM implementations balance standardized processes with organizational flexibility, emphasize continual service improvement, and align IT services with business objectives. ITIL 4, the current standard, emphasizes value co-creation and acknowledges that rigid processes can hinder innovation—a consideration relevant for AI integration.

Al-Ashmoery, Gravell and Araujo (2021) examine the impact of ITSM and ITIL frameworks on businesses, demonstrating that organizations implementing ITIL achieve 25-40% improvements in service delivery metrics including incident resolution time, service availability, and customer satisfaction. However, their research also reveals that ITIL adoption often increases process bureaucracy, potentially slowing innovation. This tension suggests that AI-augmented ITSM might offer advantages by automating process compliance while maintaining human flexibility.

### 2.7.2 IT Governance and Management

The governance structures guiding IT departments significantly influence AI integration possibilities. De Sousa Pereira and da Silva (2012) review IT governance literature, identifying guidelines and contingency factors. Their research emphasizes that effective IT governance balances centralized standards with decentralized decision-making, a principle that resonates with hierarchical multi-agent architectures where centralized orchestration coordinates decentralized agent autonomy.

### 2.7.3 Network Infrastructure Management

Network infrastructure management represents a critical IT department function where AI could provide significant value. The IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium (2023) highlights emerging challenges in managing increasingly complex, distributed network infrastructures. Sessions on AI-driven network operations demonstrate growing industry interest in intelligent automation, though practical implementations remain limited.

Industry research from Enterprise Management Associates (2024) identifies skills gaps, hybrid and multi-cloud complexity, SASE adoption, and AI-driven operations as network management megatrends. Their research reveals that 67% of network teams report insufficient staff to manage current complexity, suggesting that AI augmentation could address critical capacity constraints. However, the report also notes that AI adoption in network operations remains below 30%, indicating implementation challenges.

### 2.7.4 IT Department Collaboration and Cultural Evolution

The evolution of IT department collaboration practices provides context for AI integration. Vangala (2020) traces DevOps evolution from siloed teams to cross-functional collaboration, demonstrating that cultural transformation often proves more challenging than technical implementation. His analysis emphasizes that successful collaboration requires shared objectives, mutual respect across specializations, and communication mechanisms that transcend organizational boundaries.

Pang et al. (2023) examine DevOps culture and mindset through empirical research, revealing that successful DevOps adoption requires four cultural shifts: from individual to collective responsibility, from hierarchical to collaborative decision-making, from blame to learning orientations, and from tool-focus to people-focus. These cultural dimensions align remarkably with Ubuntu philosophy, suggesting potential synergies between DevOps practices and Ubuntu-driven AI systems.

The International Journal of Computer (2025) explores cross-industry collaboration's impact on DevOps effectiveness, finding that organizations learning from multiple industries achieve more innovative IT practices. This cross-pollination principle suggests that IT departments implementing AI agents might benefit from examining human-AI teaming practices in other domains while adapting them to technical contexts.

### 2.7.5 AI in IT Service Management

Emerging research and industry reports document growing AI adoption in ITSM. ManageEngine (2024) reports that 58% of IT organizations are exploring AI for ITSM applications, primarily in incident categorization, knowledge management, and predictive analytics. However, only 17% have deployed AI in production environments, indicating a significant exploration-to-implementation gap.

ITSM.tools and HCLSoftware (2025) provide updated perspectives showing accelerating AI adoption. Their 2025 report reveals that AI in ITSM focuses on three primary use cases: intelligent routing and escalation, automated knowledge article suggestions, and predictive service optimization. Organizations implementing AI in these areas report 30-50% improvements in first-contact resolution and 40-60% reductions in knowledge search time.

Gartner (2025) positions AI applications in ITSM within a broader market context, emphasizing that successful implementations require integration with existing ITSM platforms, robust data governance, and change management addressing staff concerns about AI replacing jobs. Their research emphasizes that AI should augment rather than replace IT staff, enabling them to focus on complex problem-solving and strategic initiatives.

### 2.7.6 Research Gap in AI-Augmented ITSM Practices

While research documents AI's potential in ITSM and IT operations, significant gaps remain. No identified research examines comprehensive multi-agent AI systems supporting full IT department hierarchies from strategic management to operational support. Existing ITSM AI research focuses on specific functions (incident management, knowledge search) rather than integrated systems spanning multiple IT specializations. Furthermore, research on how ITSM frameworks like ITIL might need adaptation for AI-augmented environments is notably absent.

## 2.8 SOUTH AFRICAN CONTEXT AND AI DEVELOPMENT

### 2.8.1 AI Adoption in South African Organizations

South Africa's unique socio-economic context shapes AI adoption patterns and priorities. Gwagwa et al. (2020) examine AI deployments across Africa, identifying benefits, challenges, and policy dimensions. Their research reveals that African AI adoptions prioritize solving local problems—healthcare access, agricultural productivity, financial inclusion—rather than pursuing AI for technological advancement alone. This problem-focused orientation aligns with Ubuntu's emphasis on collective welfare.

Nzama, Phungula and Dlamini (2024) examine AI's influence on South Africa's manufacturing industry, revealing that successful implementations address specific local challenges while adapting global best practices. Their research shows that organizations involving workers in AI implementation planning achieve 45% higher adoption rates than those imposing top-down AI initiatives, highlighting the importance of inclusive, participatory approaches consistent with Ubuntu values.

### 2.8.2 AI Research Landscape in South Africa

Pouris (2025) provides comprehensive analysis of AI research in South Africa, revealing both strengths and gaps. South African AI research demonstrates particular strength in applied domains (healthcare, agriculture, financial services) while lagging in foundational AI research compared to global leaders. Significantly, Pouris identifies organizational AI implementation as an under-researched area in South Africa, with most research focusing on technical AI capabilities rather than organizational integration methodologies.

Patterson, Breytenbach and Coffman (2025) examine AI-adoption attitudes in Southern African higher education, revealing generally positive attitudes tempered by concerns about job displacement, data privacy, and cultural appropriateness. Their research emphasizes the need for AI implementations that respect local contexts, involve stakeholders in design processes, and demonstrate tangible benefits to users rather than imposing external solutions.

### 2.8.3 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations

South Africa's regulatory environment significantly influences AI implementations. Mbonye (2024) examines the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) in AI-driven environments, revealing that POPIA's principles align well with human-centered AI approaches. However, he identifies gaps in POPIA regarding AI-specific concerns like algorithmic transparency, automated decision-making accountability, and data subject rights in AI contexts. For IT departments implementing AI systems handling personal information, POPIA compliance requires careful attention to data governance and privacy-preserving AI techniques.

Mpolomoka (2025) advocates for responsible AI policy learning in Africa, emphasizing that African countries should develop contextually appropriate AI policies rather than merely adopting Western frameworks. His research suggests that Ubuntu philosophy could inform distinctly African approaches to AI governance balancing innovation with social responsibility.

### 2.8.4 Educational and Workforce Implications

The transformation of education and workforce development for AI-integrated environments presents both opportunities and challenges in South Africa. Maimela and Mbonde (2025) examine AI in South African universities, questioning whether AI aids or obstructs curriculum transformation and decolonization. Their research reveals tensions between embracing AI for educational innovation and concerns about perpetuating Western-centric knowledge systems. They advocate for AI implementations grounded in African epistemologies and pedagogies, suggesting that Ubuntu-driven AI systems could model culturally appropriate technological integration.

### 2.8.5 Research Gap in South African Organizational AI

While research documents South Africa's AI landscape, significant gaps exist regarding organizational AI implementation, particularly in IT departments. No identified research examines how South African organizational cultures influence AI adoption patterns, how Ubuntu philosophy might be practically integrated into organizational AI systems, or how South African regulatory frameworks shape AI deployment strategies in IT operations. Furthermore, empirical research validating AI system effectiveness in South African organizational contexts remains limited, with most research focusing on global contexts that may not translate directly to local environments.

## 2.9 SYNTHESIS: THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL RESEARCH GAP

### 2.9.1 What Exists Separately

The literature review reveals extensive research across three distinct domains:

**Technical Dimension: Multi-Agent AI Systems**  
Research comprehensively addresses multi-agent system architectures, coordination mechanisms, communication protocols, and enterprise applications. Evidence demonstrates that hierarchical multi-agent systems can improve organizational productivity by 40-73% when properly implemented (Ju and Co-author, 2025; Moore, 2025). RAG systems enable AI agents to access organizational knowledge effectively (Balaguer et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024). Human-AI teaming frameworks establish principles for effective collaboration (National Academies, 2022; Berretta et al., 2023).

**Cultural Dimension: Ubuntu Philosophy in AI**  
Substantial research establishes Ubuntu's relevance for AI ethics and development (Mhlambi, 2020; van Norren, 2023). Healthcare applications demonstrate Ubuntu's implementability in AI systems (Amugongo, 2023; Mahamadou et al., 2024). Philosophical work articulates how Ubuntu's relational worldview offers alternatives to Western individualistic AI approaches (Wareham, 2021). Policy research advocates for Ubuntu-informed AI governance in African contexts (Mutswiri et al., 2025).

**Organizational Dimension: IT Department Operations**  
Research thoroughly documents ITSM frameworks, IT governance structures, network infrastructure management, and collaboration practices (Serrano et al., 2021; Al-Ashmoery et al., 2021; Pang et al., 2023). Industry reports reveal growing AI adoption in specific ITSM functions (ManageEngine, 2024; ITSM.tools, 2025). South African organizational contexts are increasingly well-understood (Pouris, 2025; Nzama et al., 2024).

### 2.9.2 What Does NOT Exist: The Integration Gap

Despite extensive research in each individual domain, **no existing research combines all three dimensions**:

**Technical + Cultural Integration**  
No research examines how Ubuntu philosophy can inform multi-agent system architectures, agent coordination mechanisms, or agent behavioral models. While Ubuntu's ethical value is acknowledged, practical methodologies for translating Ubuntu principles into agent design patterns, decision algorithms, and collaboration protocols are absent.

**Cultural + Organizational Integration**  
Research documents Ubuntu's theoretical relevance for organizational AI but lacks empirical implementations. No studies examine how Ubuntu-driven AI systems perform in real organizational IT departments, how staff perceive and adopt Ubuntu-based AI, or how Ubuntu values influence organizational AI outcomes.

**Technical + Organizational Integration**  
While research explores AI in specific ITSM functions, comprehensive multi-agent systems supporting full IT department hierarchies do not appear in the literature. No research examines AI agent teams coordinated across strategic, tactical, and operational levels respecting real organizational reporting structures.

**Three-Dimensional Integration**  
The critical gap: **Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI systems integrated with real organizational IT department workflows** has no precedent in the literature. This three-dimensional integration—cultural philosophy informing technical architecture deployed in authentic organizational contexts—represents entirely novel research territory.

### 2.9.3 Why This Gap Matters

This research gap carries both theoretical and practical significance:

**Theoretical Significance:**  
The gap represents a missed opportunity to demonstrate how indigenous knowledge systems can inform cutting-edge technology development. It leaves unanswered whether culturally-grounded AI systems outperform purely technical implementations, how organizational hierarchies should shape multi-agent architectures, and whether Ubuntu's relational philosophy enables more effective human-AI collaboration than individualistic approaches.

**Practical Significance:**  
Organizations, particularly in Africa but increasingly globally, need AI implementations that align with local cultures, respect organizational structures, and enhance rather than disrupt human work. The integration gap means organizations lack validated frameworks for implementing multi-agent AI in departmental contexts, proven methodologies for embedding cultural values in AI systems, and empirical evidence of what works in real-world organizational AI deployments.

**Methodological Significance:**  
The gap reveals a need for research methodologies that simultaneously address technical implementation, cultural authenticity, and organizational validity. Traditional research approaches examining single dimensions prove insufficient for complex socio-technical systems where cultural, technical, and organizational factors interact.

---

## 2.10 RESEARCH POSITIONING: UGENTIC'S CONTRIBUTION

The UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Departmental Collective Intelligence) framework directly addresses the identified three-dimensional research gap through:

**Technical Innovation:**  
Implementing a hierarchical multi-agent system with six specialized agents (IT Manager, Service Desk Manager, IT Support, App Support, Network Support, Infrastructure) coordinated through MCP, supported by RAG systems for organizational knowledge access, and designed to mirror actual IT department structures.

**Cultural Integration:**  
Embedding Ubuntu principles into agent behavioral models, coordination mechanisms, and human-AI interaction patterns. Each agent embodies specific Ubuntu values relevant to its organizational role, creating a system where technical functionality and cultural authenticity reinforce each other.

**Organizational Validity:**  
Deploying the system within Sun International GrandWest's real IT departments, validating effectiveness through actual incident resolution, service delivery, and collaborative problem-solving. The implementation respects authentic organizational hierarchies, workflows, and constraints rather than idealized scenarios.

This dissertation contributes:

1. **Empirical validation** of Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI in organizational contexts
2. **Methodological framework** for three-dimensional AI integration
3. **Design principles** for culturally-grounded organizational AI
4. **Evidence base** for Ubuntu's practical applicability in technical systems

## 2.11 CHAPTER SUMMARY

This literature review synthesized 56 peer-reviewed sources across seven interconnected themes, revealing both extensive research in individual domains and a critical integration gap. While multi-agent AI systems, Ubuntu philosophy, and organizational IT operations are well-studied separately, no existing research combines all three dimensions.

The review established:

- Multi-agent AI systems demonstrate significant organizational value (40-73% productivity improvements) when properly implemented
- Ubuntu philosophy offers viable ethical and design frameworks for AI, with demonstrated success in healthcare applications
- Organizational AI implementation requires systematic approaches balancing technical capability with cultural fit
- RAG systems enable AI agents to access organizational knowledge effectively
- Human-AI teaming succeeds when AI augments rather than replaces human expertise
- IT service management frameworks provide structures for organizing AI-augmented operations
- South African contexts present unique opportunities and requirements for AI development

The identified three-dimensional research gap—Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI systems in real organizational IT departments—defines the space where this dissertation makes its contribution. The UGENTIC framework represents the first empirical attempt to bridge technical architecture, cultural philosophy, and organizational workflow in an integrated AI system.

The following chapter details the research methodology employed to address this gap, examining how action research, mixed methods, and participatory approaches enable simultaneous technical validation, cultural assessment, and organizational impact evaluation.
