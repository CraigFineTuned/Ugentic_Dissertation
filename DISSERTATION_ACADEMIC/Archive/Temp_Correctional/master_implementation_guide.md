4. **Power dynamics:** Did they seem hesitant? Why?
5. **Ubuntu observations:** Which values emerged naturally?

---

# PHASE 3: DATA PROCESSING (WEEKS 4-7)

## Transcription Protocol

### Options:
1. **Manual Transcription:** Most accurate, time-intensive (4-6 hours per interview)
2. **AI Transcription:** Faster, requires careful review
   - Use: Otter.ai, Rev.com, or similar
   - CRITICAL: Check POPIA compliance
   - Manually verify accuracy
3. **Hybrid:** AI transcribe → Manual verification

### Transcription Standards:
- **Verbatim:** Include "um," "uh," pauses
- **Anonymize immediately:** Replace names with codes
- **Time stamps:** Every 5 minutes
- **Non-verbal:** [laughs], [pause], [sighs]
- **Formatting:** Speaker labels (I = Interviewer, P = Participant)

### Example:
```
I: Can you describe your role as IT Manager? [00:05:23]

P: Well, um, I've been the IT Manager for about three years now [pause] and really my main responsibility is, you know, making sure all the different IT functions work together smoothly. We've got the service desk, infrastructure, applications [gestures broadly] - it's a lot to coordinate. [00:05:45]

I: What does "working together smoothly" look like to you? [00:05:50]

P: [laughs] That's the million dollar question! For me it means, like, when someone needs help, they know where to go and they get it quickly. Not passing the buck, you know? We're all one team. [00:06:05]

[Interviewer note: Emphasized "one team" - Ubuntu concept]
```

2. **Collaboration Patterns** (how people work together)
3. **Ubuntu Values** (community, interdependence, mutual support)
4. **AI Perceptions** (hopes, fears, readiness)
5. **Information Needs** (what data people need to work effectively)
6. **Hierarchical Dynamics** (how structure affects work)

**Coding Example:**
```
Transcript excerpt:
"When infrastructure issues arise, I usually call Robin directly rather than going through the ticketing system. It's faster and he knows I need help."

Codes applied:
- INFORMAL_COMMUNICATION
- BYPASSING_FORMAL_SYSTEMS
- PERSONAL_RELATIONSHIPS
- EFFICIENCY_PRIORITY
- UBUNTU_MUTUAL_SUPPORT
```

### Phase 3: Searching for Themes (Week 8)
**Cluster codes into themes:**
- Theme: "Informal Collaboration Trumps Formal Processes"
  - Codes: informal_communication, bypassing_systems, personal_relationships
- Theme: "Ubuntu Values Drive Daily Work"
  - Codes: mutual_support, collective_problem_solving, peer_help

### Phase 4: Reviewing Themes (Week 8)
- [ ] Check themes against coded extracts
- [ ] Ensure internal homogeneity (cohesive themes)
- [ ] Ensure external heterogeneity (distinct themes)
- [ ] Create thematic map

### Phase 5: Defining & Naming Themes (Week 9)
- [ ] Write detailed theme definitions
- [ ] Select compelling examples
- [ ] Relate themes to research questions
- [ ] Connect to literature

### Phase 6: Producing the Report (Week 9-10)

- [ ] Include vivid quotes
- [ ] Analyze in relation to Ubuntu-AI framework
- [ ] Connect to quantitative data (if collected)

## Ubuntu-Specific Analysis Layer

**After thematic analysis, code specifically for Ubuntu:**

| Ubuntu Principle | Look for in Data | Example Quote Indicators |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Interconnectedness** | Statements about collective work, team dependencies | "We're all connected," "affects everyone" |
| **Collective Good** | Prioritizing team/org over individual | "what's best for the department," "we benefit together" |
| **Mutual Support** | Helping behaviors, knowledge sharing | "I always help out," "we support each other" |
| **Servant Leadership** | Service-oriented management | "my job is to help them," "I serve the team" |
| **Peer Collaboration** | Horizontal relationships, equality | "we're equals," "work side by side" |
| **Human Dignity** | Respect, value for people | "treated with respect," "valued as people" |

# PHASE 6: POST-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION (WEEKS 12-13)

## Follow-Up Interview Strategy

### Sample Selection for Follow-Up (8-10 people):
- 1 Strategic (ITM)
- 1 Tactical (ITSDM)
- 2 Specialists (ITISE, ITASE)
- 4-5 IT Techs (heavy system users)

### Follow-Up Protocol (30-45 minutes):
1. **Experience with AI Agents:**
   - What worked well? What didn't?
   - Which agent(s) did you interact with most?
   - Did it change how you work?

2. **Ubuntu Embodiment:**
   - Did AI agents feel like team members or tools?
   - Did they support collaboration?
   - Did they reflect Ubuntu values?

3. **Behavioral Changes:**
   - How did your workflow change?
   - Did team dynamics shift?
   - What surprised you?

4. **Future Recommendations:**
   - What should be improved?
   - Would you continue using it?
   - What's missing?

# PHASE 7: DISSERTATION WRITING (WEEKS 10-16)

## Chapter 4: Results (Weeks 10-12)

### Structure:
1. **Participant Demographics** (anonymized)
2. **Thematic Findings:**
   - Theme 1: [e.g., Informal Collaboration]
   - Theme 2: [e.g., Ubuntu Values in Practice]
   - Theme 3: [e.g., AI Readiness]
3. **Quantitative Results** (if metrics collected)
4. **Integration:** How themes relate to agents

### Writing Guidelines:
- Use participant codes (P001, P002)
- Include rich quotes (but not overly long)
- Analyze, don't just report
- Connect to literature
- Bold key findings for scannability

**Example:**
> **Finding 1: Informal Collaboration Supersedes Formal Processes**
>
> A dominant theme across all organizational levels was the preference for informal, relationship-based collaboration over formal ticketing systems. As one IT technician explained:
>
> *"When I need help with infrastructure, I just call Robin [ITISE]. Going through the ticketing system adds an hour to everything. We're a small team - we help each other directly."* (P008, IT Tech)
>
> This pattern aligns with Ubuntu principles of direct mutual support and interdependence (Mhlambi, 2020), suggesting that AI agents designed to facilitate rather than formalize collaboration would be more culturally aligned.

## Chapter 5: Discussion (Weeks 12-14)

### Framework: SO WHAT?
1. **Interpretation:** What do findings mean?
2. **Literature Connection:** How do they compare to existing research?
3. **Ubuntu-AI Integration:** How do findings inform agent design?
4. **Practical Implications:** What should organizations do?
5. **Theoretical Contribution:** How does this advance knowledge?
