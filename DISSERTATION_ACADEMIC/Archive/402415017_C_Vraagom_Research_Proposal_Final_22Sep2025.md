1. INTRODUCTION
The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity for businesses worldwide (Davenport & Ronanki, 2021). In South Africa, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), particularly in the IT services sector, operate in complex environments where they must navigate relationships with larger enterprise clients while maintaining operational efficiency and agile decision-making (OECD, 2022). A significant challenge in these organizations is overcoming departmental silos to foster true cross-functional collaboration, a persistent issue across various business contexts (Kanter, 2020). This research directly addresses this by proposing a collaborative, not substitutive, AI model. Leading AI authorities validate the need for systems that augment, rather than replace, human domain experts, recognizing that complex problems require "different experts" with specialized knowledge (Hassabis, 2025).
This research proposes the development of UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Departmental Collective Intelligence), an innovative AI framework that integrates the collaborative philosophy of Ubuntu - "I am because we are" - into a multi-agent AI system. This study seeks to provide a culturally-resonant, technically robust solution for optimizing organizational structures in South African IT service SMEs, with particular focus on their enterprise client relationships. This approach aligns with the growing imperative for ethical and culturally-aware AI development (Abebe et al., 2021; Mkhize, 2022).
The UGENTIC framework leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual grounding (Lewis et al., 2020), decentralized consensus algorithms for Ubuntu-aligned decision-making (Wang et al., 2023), and real-time API integrations with enterprise data systems. This proposal outlines the framework's core principles, methodology, and expected contributions, with a specific focus on a case study within the hospitality sector's IT vendor ecosystem, known for its intricate operational dependencies and multi-stakeholder dynamics (Kim & Kim, 2020).
2. BACKGROUND
South African IT service SMEs, while vital to the digital economy, face unique challenges related to client complexity, market volatility, and innovation adoption pressures (Mashau & Makhitha, 2020). These SMEs often serve large enterprise clients in sectors such as hospitality, requiring them to maintain sophisticated operational structures despite limited resources. Traditional hierarchical models often create rigid silos within SMEs, hindering information flow and collaborative decision-making, leading to reduced agility and decision latency when serving enterprise clients (Bughin, 2021; PwC, 2023).
Ubuntu philosophy - emphasizing interconnectedness, human dignity, and mutual support - offers a compelling alternative to individualistic business practices (Mkhize, 2022). The integration of this philosophy with AI, specifically multi-agent systems, presents a novel opportunity to create a technological solution that not only improves efficiency but also aligns with indigenous cultural values, fostering a more resilient and cohesive organizational structure (Ndlovu & Sibanda, 2022). This integration aims for a holistic transformation, moving beyond purely technical solutions (Gwagwa et al., 2022).
2.1 SME Challenges in IT Services & Hospitality Sector Context
IT service SMEs, particularly those serving dynamic sectors like hospitality and entertainment, encounter unique operational complexities:
●	Departmental Silos: Fragmented structures leading to poor communication, data hoarding, and suboptimal cross-functional decisions when coordinating with enterprise clients (Kanter, 2020; PwC, 2023). For example, an IT vendor's Technical Support and Account Management departments often operate in silos - Technical Support optimizes for issue resolution speed, while Account Management prioritizes client relationship satisfaction.
●	Enterprise-SME Coordination: Difficulty in aligning SME operations with enterprise client requirements, seasonal demand shifts, and evolving service expectations, crucial for contract retention (Kotter, 2021).
●	Decision Latency: Multi-layered approval processes within SMEs delay strategic and operational decisions, impacting client service responsiveness (Bughin, 2021).
●	Data Fragmentation: Challenges in integrating data from enterprise client systems (e.g., ticketing systems, service agreements, performance metrics) with internal SME operations into a single, coherent strategic view (Accenture, 2022).
2.2 Ubuntu in SME Corporate AI
UGENTIC agents will simulate Ubuntu principles, ensuring culturally resonant AI behaviour:
●	Collective Optimization: Agents negotiate for enterprise-wide Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), transcending narrow departmental goals (Mkhize, 2022). UGENTIC agents, grounded in Ubuntu, would simulate consensus-driven decisions - e.g., 'What resource allocation maximizes both service delivery quality and client satisfaction?'
●	Mutual Accountability: Agents log rationale for decisions and actions, creating transparent and auditable processes for human specialists (Ndlovu & Sibanda, 2022).
●	Ethical Grounding: Agents are designed to refuse actions violating the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) or the SME's internal ethical codes, embedding a strong ethical framework (South African Government, 2021; Shavit et al., 2023).
3. RESEARCH PROBLEM
Despite the theoretical alignment between multi-agent systems and Ubuntu philosophy, there is a critical gap in the existing literature. As confirmed by the supporting literature review, there are currently no documented SME deployments or empirical validations of an Ubuntu-informed multi-agent system in a real-world IT service SME environment, particularly in the context of enterprise client relationships (Mkhize, 2022; Ndlovu & Sibanda, 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Shavit et al., 2023).
The critical challenge lies not in creating AI that replaces human expertise, but in developing systems that recognize and leverage the irreplaceable value of specialized knowledge. As Hassabis (2025) acknowledges, complex problems require "different experts" with domain-specific knowledge that even AI leaders lack. This recognition underscores the need for AI frameworks that embody collaborative intelligence rather than substitutive automation.
The research problem is therefore to bridge this gap by conducting the first practical implementation and empirical validation of an Ubuntu-driven multi-agent AI framework within South African IT service SMEs. The specific focus is on developing a framework for aligning AI agents with real-world departmental practices and ethical standards in SMEs serving enterprise clients. This research will examine how insights from SME departmental specialists can inform the development of more realistic, ethical, and effective AI agents that truly reflect the roles and responsibilities of their human counterparts, addressing the critical challenge of human-AI alignment in complex organizational settings (Shavit et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023).
4. OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
4.1 Research Objectives
1.	Conceptualize a multi-agent AI framework where agents represent key SME departments (Technical Support, Account Management, Operations, Finance, HR) and collaborate based on Ubuntu principles, drawing on established multi-agent system design patterns (Xi et al., 2023; Wooldridge, 2020).
2.	Implement the UGENTIC framework using modern AI technologies, including multi-agent reinforcement learning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual grounding, and real-time API integrations with both SME and enterprise client systems (Wang et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020).
3.	Evaluate UGENTIC's impact on collaboration, decision latency, and organizational agility through a qualitative case study focused on SME departmental specialist interviews, operational data, and enterprise client feedback (Bunkar et al., 2024; Al-Rasheed, 2025).
4.	Develop a framework for translating real-world SME departmental practices and ethical considerations into AI agent behaviours, ensuring agents become more realistic, ethical, and aligned with human departmental roles in the IT services context (Shavit et al., 2023; Daugherty & Wilson, 2024; Park et al., 2023).
5.	Deliver a tangible, culturally-aligned, technically advanced AI solution that is beneficial to South African IT service SMEs, promoting responsible AI adoption and improved enterprise client relationships (OECD, 2022; Ndlovu & Sibanda, 2022).

7. LITERATURE REVIEW
A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed academic sources published between 2020-2025 has been conducted. Recent statements from leading AI researchers further support this collaborative approach. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, explicitly acknowledges that "you have different experts and I'm not an expert in that field" when discussing complex problem-solving (Hassabis, 2025). This recognition from a foremost AI authority validates the need for AI systems that collaborate with, rather than replace, human domain experts-precisely the approach embodied in the UGENTIC framework.
The review confirms a strong theoretical alignment between Ubuntu philosophy and multi-agent AI systems, identifying key concepts such as interconnectedness and collective well-being (Mkhize, 2022; Ndlovu & Sibanda, 2022). The literature also highlights the persistent challenges of departmental silos and decision-making latency in SMEs, particularly those serving enterprise clients, confirming the relevance of the research problem (Kanter, 2020; Bughin, 2021; PwC, 2023). Furthermore, the review underscores the critical need for robust, ethically-aligned AI solutions capable of addressing these challenges in SME contexts (Shavit et al., 2023; Daugherty & Wilson, 2024).
Recent advancements in multi-agent systems and generative AI, particularly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), provide the technical foundation for the proposed UGENTIC framework (Wang et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020; Park et al., 2023). However, a critical gap remains: the complete absence of documented, practical, and empirically validated deployments of Ubuntu-informed multi-agent AI systems in real-world IT service SME settings. This gap serves as the primary justification for this research, which aims to contribute original knowledge by providing the first empirical evidence of such an integration (Bunkar et al., 2024).
8. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
