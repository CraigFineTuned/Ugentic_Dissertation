## Abstract

Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems offer significant potential for organizational IT support but often lack cultural coherence with collaborative organizational values. This research explores whether Ubuntu philosophy—an African worldview emphasizing collective humanity and mutual support—can enhance collaboration in multi-agent AI systems within IT departments.

The research develops and implements UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Departmental Collective Intelligence), a six-agent system deployed within Sun International GrandWest Casino's IT department. Using action research methodology with explanatory sequential mixed methods design, the study operationalizes Ubuntu principles through value-explicit prompting, knowledge-augmented decision-making, and transparent communication protocols. The system employs locally-deployed open-source language models, retrieval-augmented generation for cultural knowledge access, and Model Context Protocol for agent coordination.

Initial evaluation demonstrates that Ubuntu principles can be successfully translated into measurable computational behaviors. UGENTIC agents exhibit collaborative patterns including expertise acknowledgment, collective benefit articulation, and consultative approaches to cross-domain problems. Test scenarios reveal meaningful distinctions between Ubuntu-enhanced and traditional coordination approaches, with agents explicitly expressing philosophical principles in their interactions.

The research makes four theoretical contributions: demonstrating Ubuntu as computational framework, developing a three-dimensional integration model (technical-cultural-organizational), repositioning multi-agent systems as cultural actors, and innovating knowledge retrieval for philosophical alignment. Practical contributions include implementable architecture documentation, change management insights, reusable design patterns, and local deployment guidance.

While limited by single organizational context and early-stage implementation, the research establishes feasibility and initial promise of culturally-informed AI systems. It demonstrates that organizations need not choose between AI capability and cultural coherence, offering pathways for AI systems that reinforce rather than undermine collaborative organizational values.
