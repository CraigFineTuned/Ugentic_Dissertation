## Abstract

This research presents UGENTIC (Ubuntu-Driven Departmental Collective Intelligence), the first empirical validation of Ubuntu philosophy integrated with multi-agent artificial intelligence systems in real organizational departments. The study addresses the critical gap between theoretical AI agent capabilities and practical organizational implementation by developing a novel three-dimensional integration framework combining technical innovation, cultural authenticity, and organizational practicality.

The research employs an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, implementing UGENTIC within Sun International GrandWest's IT departments. Six AI agents—representing IT Manager, Service Desk Manager, IT Support, Application Support, Network Support, and Infrastructure roles—operate through hierarchical multi-agent coordination, Model Context Protocol (MCP) communication, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge systems. The system demonstrates how Ubuntu philosophy ("I am what I am because of who we all are") manifests structurally in agent architectures, not merely as ethical overlay.

Quantitative analysis measures pre/post implementation performance across decision-making latency, coordination frequency, and service delivery metrics. Qualitative investigation through semi-structured interviews explores Ubuntu principle application, collaboration pattern changes, and transferability factors. Preliminary findings from the operational system indicate improved interdepartmental coordination and knowledge accessibility.

The study contributes theoretically by demonstrating cultural-technical integration principles for AI agent design, and practically by providing transferable frameworks for organizations implementing collaborative AI systems. It advances human-AI teaming research by validating that organizational hierarchies and cultural values can be authentically embedded in multi-agent architectures, offering evidence-based pathways for SMEs and enterprises pursuing AI-augmented collaboration while preserving human-centered values.
