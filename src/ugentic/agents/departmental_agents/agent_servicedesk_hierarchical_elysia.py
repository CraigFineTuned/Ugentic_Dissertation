# Agent_ServiceDesk_Hierarchical_Elysia - REFACTORED for Three-Dimensional Integration
# UGENTIC Framework - Elysia + MCP + Ubuntu + Hierarchical Integration
# Ubuntu Principle: "Coordination serves collective excellence" - Now with professional architecture
# 
# REFACTORING NOTES:
#  Service Desk Manager operates at MANAGER level with TACTICAL authority
#  Ubuntu servant leadership - authority serves collective good
#  Team coordination and development through Ubuntu principles
#  Cross-level communication bridge between technical teams and senior management
#  Resource allocation and priority management serving collective benefit
#  Uses Elysia Tree for management decision routing
#  Uses MCP Memory for team knowledge and performance tracking
#  Uses MCP Orchestrator for workflow coordination and team development
