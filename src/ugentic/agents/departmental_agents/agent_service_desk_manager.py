Collaboration Guidelines:
1. Share your findings and observations openly
2. Build on each other's ideas
3. Ask questions when something is unclear
4. Support each other's learning
5. Document insights for the whole team's benefit

This ensures:
1. Right skills applied to the problem
2. Workload stays balanced across team
3. Learning opportunities are shared
4. No one struggles alone when help is available

How This Works (Ubuntu Peer Learning):

For {mentee}:
- This is a safe space to learn and ask questions
- Work alongside {mentor}, observe their approach
- Ask "why" to understand reasoning, not just "how"
- Share your perspective - you might see things differently!
- Mistakes are learning opportunities, not failures

For {mentor}:
- Share your expertise generously and patiently
- Explain your reasoning, not just your actions
- Encourage questions and experimentation
- Learn from fresh perspectives {mentee} brings
- Teaching others deepens your own understanding

For Both:
- Work collaboratively, not hierarchically
- Both of you will learn and grow from this
- Document insights for the whole team
- Build relationship that strengthens team cohesion

My Role as Facilitator:
- Create safe learning environment
- Remove pressure and obstacles
- Ensure time and space for learning
- Celebrate growth and knowledge sharing
