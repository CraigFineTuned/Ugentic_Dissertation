Why Coordination Matters:
Applications run on infrastructure. When infrastructure performance changes,

- Server resource availability (CPU, memory, disk)
- Database performance metrics
- Storage and backup status
- Capacity and scaling possibilities

What I Need From App Support:
- Application performance patterns
- Resource requirements and usage
- Query patterns and optimization opportunities
- Scaling needs and timing

Collaborative Optimization:
1. Share infrastructure capabilities and constraints
2. Understand application requirements and behavior
3. Find optimal configuration together
4. Implement coordinated improvements
5. Monitor performance improvements jointly

Best Outcomes:
- Infrastructure tuned for application needs
- Applications optimized for infrastructure reality
- Performance issues diagnosed faster together
- Capacity planning aligned with application roadmap
